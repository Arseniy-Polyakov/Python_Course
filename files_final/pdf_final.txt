PARTS OF SPEECH IN ENGLISH  The words of every language fall into classes which are called  parts of speech. Each part of speech has characteristics of its own. Parts of speech differ from each other in meaning form  and function.  Different parts of speech have different lexical meanings. For  example verbs are words denoting processes to work to live  nouns are names of objects table boy adjectives are words ex - pressing characteristics good bad etc. Some part s of speech have different grammatical categories  e.g. verbs have the categories of mood tense aspect phase voice  person and number nouns have the categories of number and case  adjectives have degrees of comparison etc.  Other parts of speech are i nvariable they have only one form.  Here belong such parts of speech as prepositions and conjunctions.  Parts of speech also differ from each other in their syntactic  functions. For example verbs have the function of the predicate in  the sentence nouns ar e often used as the subject or the object of  the sentence adjectives serve as attributes or predicatives adverbs  are generally adverbial modifiers etc.  These characteristic features will be described in detail when  each part of speech is considered indi vidually.  In addition all words may be divided into two main groups  notional and structural.  Notional words have distinct lexical meanings and perform in - dependent syntactic functions in the sentence they serve either as  primary or secondary parts of t he sentence. To this group belong  the following parts of speech verbs nouns adjectives numerals  pronouns and adverbs.  Structural words differ from notional words semantically  their lexical meaning is of a more general character than that of  notional words e.g. in and even. Moreover they are sometimes  altogether devoid of it e.g. the articles the and a the conjunction  that the preposition of etc..  Structural words do not perform  any independent syntactic function in the sentence but serve ei ther to express various relations between words in a sentence e.g. the trees in the garden Tom and Joe etc. or to specify the meaning  of a word e.g. the book a book etc.. The following parts of  speech are to be treated as structural words articles  prepositions  and conjunctions.  The division of words into notional and structural is connected  with certain difficulties. For example verbs which on the whole  are to be treated as notional words include certain words which  serve as structural elemen ts e.g. modal verbs some other verbs  may function either as notional words or as structural words e.g. to look is a notional verb in He looked at me and a structural word  a link -verb   in He looked tired the verb to have is a notional  verb in I  have  a car and a structural word   a modal verb   in I had to do it. Pronouns may be quoted as another example since  on the one hand they have like all notional words independent  syntactic functions in the sentence but on the other hand they  are devoid of distinct lexical meaning.  VERBS   1. According to content verbs can be described as words de - noting actions the term actions embracing the meaning of activ - ity e.g. to walk to speak to play to study process e.g. to sleep  to wait to live  state e.g. to be to like to know relation e.g. to consist to resemble to lack and the like.  According to form verbs can be described as words that have  certain grammatical features that are not shared by other parts of  speech e.g. they have th e categories of tense aspect voice etc.  According to function verbs can be defined as words making  up the predicate of the sentence.   2. Verbs can be classified under different heads.  1 According to their meaning verbs can be divided into two  groups   terminative and durative verbs.  Terminative verbs imply a limit beyond which the action can - not continue. To put it differently they have a final aim in view  e.g. to open to close to bring to recognize to refuse to break.  With the verb to open for example that means that after opening  the door it is impossible to go on with the action as the door is al - ready open.  Durative verbs do not imply any such limit and the action can  go on indefinitely e.g. to carry to live to speak to know to sit  to play.  But as most verbs in English are polysemantic they may be ter - minative in one meaning and durative in another. For example to see may have the terminative meaning   and the durative  meaning   to know may denote   and - The meaning of the verb becomes clear from the context. Compare I  saw him at once and I saw his face quite clearly. As will be seen  the distinction between terminative and durative verbs is of great  importance as it affects the use of certain tense -aspect -phase  forms.  2 According to their relation to the continuous form English  verbs fall into two groups dynamic verbs i.e. verbs which admit  of the continuous form a and stative verbs i.e. verbs which do  not admit of the continuous form b.  e.g. a We were eating dinner when he called.  Youll find Mother in the kitchen. She is making a cake  b I understand what you mean.  I dont see him in the crowd.  The distinction between dynamic and stative verbs is funda - mental in English grammar and it  is also reflected in a number of  other ways than in the continuous form.  It is normal for verbs to be dynamic and even the minority that  are almost always stative can be given a dynamic use on occasion.  The following is the list of most commonly used sta tive verbs  a verbs denoting physical perceptions to hear to notice to see  b verbs denoting emotions to adore to care for to detest to  dislike to hate to like to love to respect  c verbs denoting wish to desire to want to wish  d verbs denoting ment al processes to admire  to be of high  opinion to appreciate to assume to believe  to consider to con sider  to regard to doubt to expect  to suppose to feel  to consider to imagine to know to mind  to object to perceive to  presume to recall to recognize to recollect to regard to remember  to suppose to think  to consider to trust to understand  e relational verbs to apply to be to belong to concern to con - sist to contain to depend to deserve to differ to eq ual to fit to  have to hold  to contain to include to involve to lack to mat - ter to need to owe to own to possess to remain to require to re - semble to result to signify to suffice  f some other verbs to agree to allow to appear  to seem  to astonish to claim to consent to displease to envy to fail to  do to feel intrl to find to forbid to forgive to intend to inter - est to keep doing to manage to do to mean to object to please  to prefer to prevent to puzzle to r ealize to refuse to remind to  satisfy to seem to smell intr1 to sound intr1 to succeed to  suit to surprise to taste intr1 to tend to value.  1 As in The surface feels rough. The song sounds nice. The soup tastes smells nice. 3 English  verbs are also classified according to the type of ob - ject they take. Verbs that do not require any object are called  intransitive.  e.g. We walked across the fields.  Nobody knew where the old man lived.  Verbs that require some kind of object to complete their mean - ing are called transitive. The objects transitive verbs take may be  direct a indirect b or prepositional c.  e.g. a I swear Im telling the truth.  b His mother never gave him advice.  c Now lets talk of something sensible.  Polysemantic verbs  may be transitive in one meaning and in - transitive in another.  e.g. I didnt know where to find him as he had changed his address.  I was glad to see that he had not changed at all.  He ran uphill past a block of houses.  She ran the shop quite competently.   3. According to their meaning and function in the sentence  English verbs are classified into notional and structural ones.  Notional verbs always have a lexical meaning of their own  and can have an independent syntactic function in the sentence.  e.g. Dur ing the war he lived in London.  When a verb is used as a structural word it may either pre - serve or lose its lexical meaning. But even if it has a lexical  meaning of its own the latter is of a specific character and the  verb cannot have an independent s yntactic function in the sen - tence   it is always closely connected with some other word.  Here belong modal verbs and link -verbs.  A modal verb is always accompanied by an infinitive   to- gether they form a modal predicate.  e.g. The party is at eight. You  must dress suitably for it.  I couldnt do anything under the circumstances.  A link -verb is followed by a predicative together they form a  nominal predicate.  e.g. He was a middle -aged man.  It became very hot by noon.  The hotel remained empty all through the winter.  The cottage seemed deserted.  Sometimes a verb is entirely devoid of lexical meaning and is  then called an auxiliary verb. Combined with a notional verb it  serves to build up analytical forms.  e.g. We had arranged to meet in the usual place.  Do you know why he said that?  The young man was sitting at the table alone.  Polysemantic verbs may be notional as well as structural words.  e.g. He is married and has three children a notional verb used in  the meaning to possess.  I had to reconsider my po sition a structural word a modal  verb denoting obligation part of a modal predicate.  It has happened now he said so theres nothing to do  a structural word an auxiliary verb which serves to build  up an analytical form.  He looked at me waiting  for the next words  notional verb  meaning glanced.  He looked quite happy a structural word a link -verb meaning  seemed.   4. English verbs are characterized by a great variety of forms  which can be divided into two main groups according to the fun c- tion they perform in the sentence the finite forms and the non -fi- nite forms.  The finite forms have the function of the predicate in the sen - tence and may also be called the predicative forms.  The non -finite or non -predicative forms can have various other  functions they are used as the predicate of the sentence only by  way of exception. These forms are often called the verbals see  Verbs  163 -254.  The finite forms of the verb have the following grammatical  categories  1 Person and Number. Thes e categories of the verb serve to  show the connection between the subject and the predicate of the  sentence   the subject agrees with the predicate in person and  number. We find three persons the first the second and the  third  and two numbers the si ngular and the plural in finite  verbs see the formation of finite forms Verbs  9 11 15 17  22 25 29 33 38 40 43 45.  2 Tense Aspect and Phase see Verbs  7.  3 Voice see Verbs  61 -63. 4 Mood see Verbs  122 -125.   5. The forms  that serve to express the above mentioned  grammatical categories may be built up in different ways.  We find three basic forms that serve as a foundation for build - ing up all the other forms of the English verb. These forms are  1 the plain verb stem whi ch is also often referred to as the infini - tive without the particle to 2 the Past Indefinite and 3 the par - ticiple.  According to the way of forming the Past Indefinite and the  participle all verbs can be divided into two classes regular and ir - regular verbs.  With regular verbs the Past Indefinite and the participle are  formed by adding the suffix -ed. It is pronounced d after vowels  and voiced consonants e.g. played answered opened closed t after voiceless consonants e.g. looked passe d and id after  verbs ending in t or d e.g. wanted wasted ended landed.  In writing the following spelling rules should be observed  1 Verbs ending in -y preceded by a consonant change the -y into -led e.g. study   studied envy   envied. But if  the -y is preceded by a vowel it remains unchanged e.g. play   played  stay  stayed.  2 A final consonant is doubled if it is preceded by a short  stressed vowel or if a verb ends in a stressed -er -ur e.g. stop  stopped admit   admitted occur   occurred prefer   pre- ferred. But if the preceding vowel is long or unstressed the final  consonant remains single e.g. limit   limited perform   per- formed conquer   conquered appear   appeared.  3 A final -l is always doubled in British English e.g. trav- el  travelled quarrel   quarrelled.  All other verbs should be regarded as irregular in modern En - glish. They are a miscellaneous group comprising various patterns  e.g. sing   sang   sung write   wrote   written send  sent  sent teach   taught  taught etc.- Some verbs have a  regular form by the side of an irregular one e.g. learn   learnt   learnt and also learn   learned   learned. A number of  verbs remain unchanged e.g. cut  cut  cut hit   hit  hit. Two verbs take their forms fr om different roots and are called  suppletive systems. They are the verbs to be and to go. For a  complete list of irregular verbs see Appendix.   6. The forms of the verb which are built up with the help of  the above described basic forms may be of two di fferent kinds  synthetic or analytical.  Synthetic forms are built up by a change in the word itself by  means of suffixes e.g. I work he works we worked by means of  vowel change e.g. I find I found and sometimes by combining  both means e.g. I think I thought.  Analytical forms consist of two components e.g. He has worked hard. The first component is an auxiliary verb which has  no lexical meaning   it expresses only grammatical meaning. The  second component is a notional verb which is the bearer  of lexical  meaning      . The auxiliary verb  shows that has worked is the third person singular the Indicative  Mood the Active Voice. But the specific meaning of this particu - lar form that of the Present Perfect results only from the combi - nation of both components.  In the analytical form was written as in The letter was written  yesterday written is the bearer of lexical meaning was shows that  we are dealing with the third person singular the Indicative Mood  the Past Indefinite But aga in the specific grammatical meaning of  this particular form that of the Passive Voice is expressed by the  whole combination of the auxiliary and the notional verb.  Thus an analytical form consists of two words   a structural  word and a notional word   which form a very close inseparable  unit. It functions in English as the form of a single word by the  side of synthetic forms e.g. he works he has worked he worked  he was working he had worked etc..  The auxiliary verb itself may be an analytical form  e.g. He has been working. He will be working. The letter has been written  etc.. Such forms may be called complex analytical forms.  FINITE FORMS OF THE VERB  Tense Aspect and Phase   7. Tense is the form of the verb which indicates the time of  the acti on. The category of tense in English is made up by a set of  forms opposed to each other in referring the event or state de - scribed to the present past or future.  Aspect is the form of the verb which serves to express the  manner in which the action is reg arded. There are two opposing  sets of aspect forms in English   the Continuous forms and the  Non-Continuous Indefinite forms. The Non -Continuous Indefi - nite forms have a very broad meaning they have no specialized  aspect characteristics of their own and merely represent an action  as occurring. Conversely the Continuous forms have a clear -cut aspect characteristic which is to represent an action in its tempo - rary development. The Continuous forms have a number of other  concomitant meanings or overto nes that go with the basic meaning  of process and duration. They are incompletion simultaneity viv - idness of description emotional colouring and emphasis.  Besides there are the Perfect forms which are opposed to the  Non-Perfect forms. The latter have no definite grammatical char - acteristics. The grammatical meaning of the Perfect forms is to  express retrospectiveness which consists of two elements   prior - ity and relevance. In some grammars this category has been given  the name phase.  The three gram matical categories of the English verb are so  closely merged together that it is impossible to treat them sepa - rately.  We find the following finite forms in English the Present In - definite the Present Continuous the Present Perfect the Present  Perfec t Continuous the Past Indefinite the Past Continuous the  Past Perfect the Past Perfect Continuous the Future Indefinite  the Future Continuous the Future Perfect the Future Indefinite - in-the-Past the Future Continuous -in-the-Past and the Future  Perfect -in-the-Past.   8. 1 In discussing the use of English finite forms it is neces - sary to understand that in most cases the choice is free the form  is chosen in accordance with the meaning the speaker wishes to  convey and does not depend on the stru cture of the sentence e.g.  He knows English. He knew English. He will know English.  In certain cases however the choice of the form is determined  by the structure of the sentence usually the kind of clause in  which it is used. For example the use of t he Present Indefinite  with reference to the future in a clause of time or condition a  or the use of a finite form under the rules of the sequence of  tenses b.  e.g. a When you feel hungry Ill bring you some sandwiches.  If I want anything Ill call y ou up.  b She knew that Henry would be waiting for her.  I wondered if he had kept his promise.  In such cases we have the structurally dependent use of finite  forms.  In still other cases the choice of the finite form in a sub - ordinate clause is determined not so much by the kind of clause  as by the lexical character of the head -word i.e. the word in the  principal clause which the subordinate clause modifies or refers  to. For example in object clauses subordinated to the verbs to see to to take care or to make sure the future forms are not  used.  e.g. Hell take care that she comes in time.  She saw to it that they had plenty of food in the house.  In such cases we have the lexically -dependent use of finite  forms.  2 Closely connected with the above notion is  the absolute and relative use of finite forms. The forms may refer an action direct - ly to the present past or future time. We are dealing in this case  with the absolute use of finite forms which as a rule is structur - ally independent.  But in certain  types of clauses the verb form of the sub - ordinate clause only shows whether the action of the clause is si - multaneous with that of the principal clause precedes it or follows  it. These relations may be termed as simultaneity priority and posteriorit y respectively. In this case we are dealing with the rela - tive use of finite forms. It is usually structurally dependent see  for example the rules of the sequence of tenses.  e.g. He discovered that his wife knew London far better than he did. He knew that she had read his thoughts.  He thought that he would hate the place.  3 Last but not least students of English should differentiate  between present -time contexts and past-time contexts.  In present -time contexts i.e. in conversations letters newsp a- per and radio reports lectures and scientific prose the situation is  viewed from the moment of speaking. The moment of speaking is  to be understood as present from the speakers point of view but  not as the present moment. Any finite form that is re quired by  the sense can be used in present -time contexts. The only reserva - tion should be made for the Past Perfect and the Past Perfect Con - tinuous and all the Future -in-the-Past forms which are in present - time contexts mainly found in reported speec h or thought.  In past-time contexts i.e. in narration the situation is viewed  from a past moment. Hence the use of finite forms is restricted  only to past forms including the Future -in-the-Past.  The Present Indefinite   9. The Present Indefinite is form ed from the plain stem of  the verb. In the third person singular it has the suffix -s-es which  is pronounced z after vowels and voiced consonants e.g. plays  opens s after voiceless consonants e.g. looks puts and iz af - ter sibilants e.g. closes places teaches wishes judges.  In writing the following spelling rules should be observed  a Verbs ending in -s -ss -sh -ch -tch  x and -z take the suffix  -es e.g. passes pushes watches. The suffix -es is also added to  verbs ending in  preceded by a consonant e.g. goes.  b Verbs ending in -y with a preceding consonant change the -y into -ies e.g. study   studies try   tries fly   flies. But if the   is preceded by a vowel the suffix -s is added e.g. play  plays  stay  stays.  The affirmative form of the Present Indefinite is a synthetic  form e.g. I work he works etc.. But the interrogative and nega - tive forms are built up analytically by means of the auxiliary verb  do in the Present Indefinite and the infinitive of the noti onal verb  without the particle to e.g. Do you work? Does he work? I do not  work. He does not work etc.. In spoken English the contracted  negative forms dont and doesnt should be used.  The Present Indefinite may have a special affirmative form  which i s used for emphasis. This emphatic form is built up analyti - cally by means of the Present Indefinite of the auxiliary verb to  do followed by the infinitive of the notional verb without the par - ticle to. The auxiliary verb is heavily stressed in this cas e e.g. I do insist on it. He does insist on it.   10. The Present Indefinite is used in the following cases  1 When it serves to express recurrent a or permanent b ac - tions in the present.  a We find recurrent actions with terminative verbs. They  are as a matter of fact point instantaneous actions repeated a num - ber of times. This series of recurrent actions may include or ex - clude the actual moment of speaking.  This use of the Present Indefinite is often associated with such  adverbial modif iers of frequency as often seldom sometimes occa - sionally always never ever every year week month day usual - ly once twice three times a year daily on Sundays Mondays  etc. and the like. But it may also be found without any indica - tions of time.  e.g. He wakes up around six oclock and has a cup of coffee.  He doesnt usually ring up early in the morning.  Do you often come to these parties? inquired Jordan of the  girl beside her.  The charwoman comes in daily.  b We find permanent actio ns with durative verbs. They gener - ally indicate continuous uninterrupted processes which naturally  include the present moment. Such actions give a general character - istic to the person or thing denoted by the subject. Time indica - tions are not obligat ory in this case.  e.g. Her son works near here and so after her husbands death  she came down to live here and he boards with her.  That old man gave me a surprise. Hes seventy -five and he  doesnt walk he runs.  I teach English and History at a college  and I live with my  parents.  I hate authority. It spoils the relations between parent and  child.  Like all young men he sleeps like a log.  As is seen from the above examples the difference between  the two main uses of the Present Indefinite rests on the differ - ence in the lexical character of the verb. In many cases however  owing to the context or situation the difference appears blurred  and it becomes difficult to define the lexical character of the verb.  In other words we are dealing with marginal cases in this instance  a permanent characteristic is given through recurrent actions.  e.g. I always talk too much when Im nervous.  I sometimes play the piano for five hours a day.  He usually walks to the corner with Phil.  Edith always gets away with thi ngs.  Note. The Present Indefinite is often said to express a general statement or a  universal truth. In this case it also denotes either a recurrent action or a perma - nent process and thus it does not differ in principle from the two above described  uses of the Present Indefinite.  e.g. Domestic animals return to their homes.  Romance only dies with life.  Still waters run deep a proverb  A mothers love means devotion unselfishness sacrifice.  2 When it is used to express a succession of point actions ta k- ing place at the time of speaking. In this meaning it is used in  stage directions or by radio and TV commentators in describing  sports events public functions etc. That means that this use of  the Present Indefinite is stylistically restricted.  e.g. a  In stage directions  REV. S. Good night. They shake hands. As he passes Vivie  he shakes hands with her also and bids her good -night.  Then in booming command to Frank Come along Sir  at once.  b In comments here on a TV film about Chi -Chi the giant  panda who returns home after her stay in the Moscow  Zoo  Chi -Chi is in the pen. She walks over to the travelling box.  Chi-Chi climbs on the rock. The crowd moves closer to  Chi-Chi.   In demonstrations  Now I peel the apples slice them and put into t he dish.  Then I whip the cream until thick and pour it over the  apples.  3 The Present Indefinite is sometimes used to express a single  action going on at the moment of speaking where normally the  Present Continuous is used. This occurs in two different ca ses a The use of the Present Indefinite becomes obligatory with  stative verbs. For the list see Verbs  2.  e.g. I quite understand what you mean.  She sipped her coffee and pulled a face. It tastes horrible  tonight.  He wants to see you for a minute . Do you object Dad? said the girl.  b The Present Indefinite is also used for an instantaneous ac - tion which takes place at the moment of speaking but it is not  viewed in its progress. The speaker just names the occurrence it - self the action as such . e.g. I repeat the girl has been extremely impertinent he said.  You leave me no choice.  I swear it to you!  I refuse to listen to you. You talk such nonsense.  Where shall we have our meal? Anywhere you like.  I choose the kitchen then.  Youve alw ays treated me badly and now you insult me  Maurice shouted in his turn.  This use of the Present Indefinite is also often found in ex - clamatory and interrogative sentences.  e.g. My dear how you throw about your money!  She said How swiftly the years fly! May I help you to wash the baby? It is very kind of you.  Ah how he kicks! Has he splashed you?  Why do you talk like that to me?  4 The Present Indefinite may be used to express future ac - tions. This occurs in four different cases  a Its use is structurally dependent see Verbs 8 i.e. compulsory in subordinate clauses of time condition and conces - sion when the action refers to the future in such cases we usual - ly find the Future Indefinite or modal verbs or the Imperative  Mood in the  principal clause.  Clauses of time referring to the future may be introduced by  the conjunctions when while till until before after as soon as  and once.  e.g. Will you wait while I look through the manuscript?  She wont go to bed till you come.  I sha ll have a look at his paper when I get it.  Clauses of condition are introduced by the conjunctions if un - less on condition that provided providing and in case.  e.g. If you send me a line to my club itll be forwarded at once.  But I must have the d octor handy in case she feels worse.  Note. In clauses other than those of time and condition the Future Indefinite  is used even if these clauses are introduced by the conjunctions if and when.  e.g. I wonder if the tape recorder will eventually replace th e record player.  The important thing to know is when the book will come out.  Clauses of concession are introduced by the conjunctions even  if even though no matter how whenever whatever however etc. e.g. Even if he hates me I shall never do him any h arm.  Ill have dinner whenever its ready.  b Its use is lexically dependent in object clauses after to see  to to take care and to make be sure.  e.g. Ill see that the lady is properly looked after.  Her husband will look after her and make sure no ha rm comes to her.  He will take care that no one interferes with them.  c The use of the Present Indefinite with reference to the im - mediate future is structurally dependent in some special questions.  e.g. What do we do next?    ?  Where do we go now?   ?  What  happens  next?   ?  You look ill. Why dont you go home?    - .      ?  d The Present Indefinite may be used to indicate a future ac - tion which is c ertain to take place according to a timetable pro - gramme schedule command or arrangement worked out for a per - son or persons officially. In this case the sentence usually contains  an indication of time.  e.g. Is Mr Desert in? No Sir. Mr Desert has just started for the  East. His ship sails tomorrow.  according to the timetable  Our tourist group sleep at the Globo hotel this night and start for Berlin tomorrow morning  according to the itinerary  Can you tell me what time the game starts today pl ease?  according to the schedule  When does Ted return from his honeymoon? according to his  official leave of absence  You see in six weeks his regiment goes back to the front ac- cording to the command  Note. It should be noted that this use of the P resent Indefinite is not inter - changeable with the Present Continuous. See Verbs  11.  5 The Present Indefinite is used in literary style to describe a  succession of actions in the past usually to make a vivid narrative  of past events. This applica tion of the Present Indefinite is often  called in grammars the historic or dramatic present.  e.g. She arrives full of life and spirit. And about a quarter of an  hour later she sits down in a chair says she doesnt feel  well gasps a bit and dies.  The Pres ent Continuous   11. The Present Continuous is an analytical form which is built up by means of the auxiliary verb to be in the Present Indefi - nite and the ing-form of the notional verb e.g. I am working. He  is working etc.. The same auxiliary is used in the interrogative  and the negative form e.g. Are you working? Is he working? We  are not working. He is not working etc.. In spoken English the  contracted forms I  hes and were should be used in affirma  tive sentences and isnt and arent in negat ive sentences.  The ing-form is built up by adding the suffix -ing to the stem  of the verb e.g. speak   speaking.  In writing the following spelling rules should be observed  a A mute -e at the end of the verb is dropped before the suffix  -ing e.g. close   closing make   making.  b A final consonant is doubled if it is preceded by a short  stressed vowel or if a verb ends in a stressed -er -ur e.g. cut  cutting begin   beginning prefer   preferring occur   occur - ring  c A final -I is always doubled in  British English e.g. travel  travelling quarrel   quarrelling.  d A final -y is preserved no matter what sound it is preceded  by e.g. study   studying stay   staying.  e A final ie changes into -y e.g. tie  tying lie   lying.   12. The Present Contin uous is used with dynamic verbs in  the following cases  1 To express an action going on at the present moment i.e.  the moment of speaking.  The precise time limits of the action are not known its begin - ning and its end are not specified. The indication of time is not  necessary in this case though occasionally such adverbial modifiers  as now and at present are found.  e.g. Do you know where Philip is? I expect he is talking to  Mother.  I asked Is anything new happening?  Oh hullo he said. Do you want to see me? No thanks.  Im looking for my father.  Tears flowed slowly down her cheeks. What are you crying  for?  Oh mummy! The eggs are burning! The coffee is boiling over!  Where is the large tray? Where do you keep things? cried  Adeline.  2 To express an action going on at the present period. In this  case the precise time limits of the action are not known either. Be - sides the action may or may not be going on at the actual moment  of speaking. As in the previous case indications of time are not necessary here either.  e.g. But youve not been in England much lately. Public opinion  is changing. I must tell you about it.  And what are you doing in Geneva? Im writing a play  said Ashenden.  The great detective has retired from business. He is  growing  roses in a little cottage in Dorking.  I stay indoors most of the time. I  m catching up with my  studies.  Theyre getting ready to move to their new house.  Sometimes this Present Continuous shows that for the time be - ing a certain action happens to  be the most important and charac - teristic occupation for its doer for this see the last four examples  above.  Note. Notice the phrase to be busy doing something. It is synonymous in  meaning with the Present Continuous in the first and second cases of it s use. The  phrase is very common in English.  e.g. Father is busy cutting the grass in the garden.  Nigel is busy getting himself into Parliament.  3 To express actions generally characterizing the person de - noted by the subject bringing out the persons t ypical traits. Of - ten the adverbial modifiers always and constantly are found in  these sentences  e.g. People are always blaming their circumstances for what they  are. Youre always showing off she said to her brother in a loud  whisper.  Her husband ret orted Youre constantly complaining that you  have too much to do.  The Present Continuous in this case imparts a subjective emo - tionally coloured tone. When no emotional colouring is implied  the Present Indefinite is used to give an objective characte ristic  see Verbs  10 b. Cf. Old uncle Harry is always thinking hes going to be ruined.  You people always think Ive a bag of money.  Note. Note the following sentence patterns in which recurrent actions are  made emotionally coloured by the use of the Present Continuous.  e.g- I wonder if all grown -up people play in that childish way when nobody is looking?  When Adeline is grinning we know she is happy.  When I see him he is always eating something.  4 To express actions which will take place in the near future  due to ones previous decision. For that reason the action is re - garded as something definitely settled. We usually find an indica - tion of future time in this case see also Verbs  47.  e.g. I am sailing early next month he said.  Are y ou dining out tonight?  He is having a meeting with the men this afternoon.  Im staying the night at Green Street said Val.   13. As has been said above the Present Continuous is used with  dynamic verbs. However some stative verbs see Verbs  2 2 when they change their meaning can be used in the Continuous form.  e.g. Are you seeing Clare tonight? she asked.  He said Im seeing you home.  Are you going in the water? Sybil said. Im seriously con - sidering it.  Jane turned away. The thing to do she said is to pay no  attention to him. He is just being silly.  Note. Notice that in cases like those above the verb to be is close to to behave  in meaning.  Special attention should be paid to the verb to have which in  its original meaning to poss ess does not admit of the continuous  form.  e.g. Suddenly he came in and said Have you a letter for me  postman?  But with a change of its meaning the use of the continuous  form becomes the rule if it is required by the sense. Namely it oc - curs when to have is part of set phrases as in to have a bath to  have a good holiday to have a party to have a smoke to have a  walk to have coffee to have dinner to have something done to  have to do something to have trouble and the like.  e.g. Where is Mr  Franklin? he asked. Hes having a bath.  Hell be right out.  I know you are having your difficulties.  My village will be as pretty as a picture. Trees along the  street. You see Im having them planted already.  Some of the other verbs included in the l ist of stative verbs  may also be occasionally used in the continuous form. Then the ac - tions indicated by these verbs express great intensity of feeling.  e.g. Youll find it a great change to live in New York. At the  present time Im hating it she sa id in an expressionless  tone.  Strange he said how when people are either very young  or very old they are always wanting to do something they  should not do.  Dear Amy Ive settled in now and I am liking my new life very  much.   14. Some durative ver bs for example verbs of bodily sensa - tion to ache to feel to hurt to itch etc. and such verbs as to wear to look  to seem to shine and some other can be used ei - ther in the Present Indefinite or in the Present Continuous with  little differen ce in meaning.  Cf.   Youre looking well cousin Joan.  You look quite happy today.  I know what you are feeling Roy she said. We all feel ex- actly the same.  The Present Perfect   15. The Present Perfect is an analytical form which is built  up by mean s of the auxiliary verb to have in the Present Indefinite  and the participle of the notional verb e.g. I  have worked. He has  worked etc.- On the formation of the participle see Verbs  5 and Appendix. The same auxiliary is used to form the interrog a- tive and negative forms e.g. Have you worked? Has he worked?  It has not worked. They have not worked. In spoken English the  contracted forms Ive hes shes its weve youve and theyve  are used in affirmative sentences and havent and hasnt in nega - tive sentences.   16. The Present Perfect falls within the time sphere of the   present and is not used in narration where reference is made to  past events. It follows from that that the Present Perfect is used  in present -time contexts i.e. conver sations newspaper and radio  reports lectures and letters.  The Present Perfect has three distinct uses. They will be fur - ther referred to as Present Perfect I Present Perfect II and Present Perfect III.  1 Present Perfect I is the Present Perfect proper . It is used to  express an accomplished action which is viewed from the moment  of speaking as part of the present situation. Attention in this case  is centred on the action itself. The circumstances under which the  action occurred appear unimportant and im material at the moment  and need not be mentioned.  e.g. He is very sensitive I have discovered that.  Ive had a talk with him. He says he has all the proof he wants.  Such news! Weve bought a racehorse.  Ive spoiled everything she said.  His secretary sa id tactfully Ive put off your other appoint - ments for a while.  It should be especially noted that though the action expressed  in the Present Perfect is regarded as already accomplished it be - longs to the present -time sphere and is treated as a prese nt action.  It becomes obvious from the periphrasis  Ive heard the doctors opinion  I know the doctors opinion.  Shes gone off to the woods  She is in the woods.  A similar idea of an accomplished action is also traced in such  expressions referring to  the present as He is awake. Im late. The work is done. The door is locked etc. Since it is the action itself that the Present Perfect makes im - portant it is frequently used to open up conversations newspaper  and radio reports or letters or to intro duce a new topic in them.  However if the conversation report or letter continues on the  same subject going into detail the Present Perfect usually changes  to the Past Indefinite as the latter is used to refer to actions or sit - uations which are defi nite in the mind of the speaker. Usually but  not necessarily some concrete circumstances of the action time  place cause purpose manner etc. are mentioned in this case.  e.g. You are all right. You are coming round. Are you feeling  better?  Im q uite all right. But what has happened? Where am I?  Youre in a dug -out You were buried by a bomb from a  trench -mortar.  Oh was I? But how did I get here?  Someone dragged you. I am afraid some of your men were  killed and several others were wounded.  Pussy Cat Pussy Cat  Pussy Cat Pussy Cat  Where have you been?  What did you see there?  Ive been to London  I saw a little mouse  To look at the Queen.  Under her chair.  As is seen from the above examples the Present Perfect is  used to name a new  action whereas the Past Indefinite is used to  refer back to a definite action and the attention in this case is of - ten drawn rather to the circumstances attending the action than to  the action itself.  Note. The functions of the Present Perfect and the P ast Indefinite may be in a  way compared with those of the indefinite and the definite articles.  The indefinite article is used when an object is just named e.g. Glue me a book. She is a teacher. I have a brother. Likewise the Present Perfect serves to  name an accomplished action see the examples above.  Both the definite article and the Past Indefinite are used when an object or an  action respectively is definite in the mind of the speaker e.g. The book is on the table. The teacher returned the compos itions  As has been said Present Perfect I is mainly used to introduce  a new topic. But it may also be used to sum up a situation.  e.g. Ive done bad things I said but I dont think I could have  done some of the things youve done.  Youve so often  been helpful in the past. Ive tried said  Joseph.  Weve all been young once you know. Weve all felt it Roy.  Im afraid Ive been horribly boring and talked too much  she said as she pressed my hand.  Agatha has told me everything. How cleverly yo u have both  kept your secret  You and your wife have been very good to me. Thank you.  In accordance with its main function   just to name an ac- complished action   the Present Perfect is generally used when  the time of the action is not given.  e.g. H e sat down. You have not changed he said. No? What  have you come for? To discuss things.  Mr   has told me such wonderful things about you.  Walter.  I havent thought about it she returned.  However sometimes even though there may be no indication  of past time in the sentence the Present Perfect cannot be used  because reference is made to happenings which are definite in the  mind of the speaker either because the action has already been  mentioned or because the situation is very well known to the lis - tener. In this case the use of the Past Indefinite is very common.  e.g. Did you sleep we ll? I didnt understand you.  Did you enjoy the play?  Did you have a good journey  Did you like the book?  trip ride flight day time?  What did you say?  Did you see the accident?  Did you hear what he said?  Im sorry I lost my temper.  I didnt hear your q uestion.  It is possible however to use the Present Perfect when there  is an adverbial modifier of time in the sentence that denotes a pe - riod of time which is not over yet e.g. today this morning this  week this month this year etc. e.g. What Rosan na has done tonight is clear enough Tonight is  not over yet.  This year we have taken only one assistant. This year is not  over.  I have had only one new dress this summer exclaimed  June. This summer is not over yet.  Conversely if the period is ove r or reference is made to a par - ticular past point of time within that period the Past Indefinite  is used.  e.g. Did you see the letter in the Times this morning? It is  no longer morning. No. I havent had time to look at a  paper today Today is n ot over yet.  Whom do you think I passed in Richmond Park today! To - day is not over but the action took place at a particular  point of time within today namely when the person was in  Richmond Park.  I wasnt very well this morning but Im perfectl y all right  now. This morning is over.  Note. It should be noted that sometimes an adverbial modifier of place points  to a past period of time.  e.g. Did you see him at the theatre?  when you were at the theatre  I ran into her in Oxford Street.  when  I was in Oxford Street  The Present Perfect may be found with certain adverbs of in - definite time and frequency such as just    not ... yet already before always ever never often seldom recently late  ly of late etc. e.g. Shes just missed being run over.  I havent even had coffee yet. He has never made a sixpence by any of his books.  Have you heard of him lately?  What is the point? Ive made it clear enough before.  However the use of the Present Perfect is by no means obliga - tory with the above mentioned adverbs because any other finite  form may be used with these adverbs if it is required by the situ a- tion.  e.g. He was studying to be a pianist but he never touches the pi - ano now.  He noticed that the leaves of the chestnut were already begin - ning to turn yellow and brown.  His room was not yet furnished and he liked it to remain  empty.  Note 1. Note  the use of the Past Indefinite with just now.  e.g. I told you just now I had never had time for much fun.  Note 2. Russian students of English under the influence of the Russian lan - guage tend to use the adverb already nearly in every sentence containin g the  Present Perfect. That is not characteristic of the English language as it is suffi - cient to use the Present Perfect alone to express an accomplished action. The addi - tion of already appears redundant in many cases.  It follows from the rules above that the Present Perfect is not  used when there is an indication of past time in the sentence. It is  the Past Indefinite that is used in this case because the mention  of the definite past time ties the action to the past -time sphere as  it were and it cann ot break through to the present.  e.g. Put on your clothes at once and come with me. But what  is it? Has something happened? Im  afraid so. Your  husband was taken ill this afternoon.  M. Poirot you have no idea of what I have gone through.  I know y our wife died just over a year ago.  Similarly it is the Past Indefinite that is used in questions in - troduced by when.  e.g. When did you actually arrive?  When did you change your mind?  The Past Indefinite is also used in special questions beginning  with  where and how when they refer to the past events. The  Present Perfect is not common here because the attention in such  sentences is drawn to the circumstances of the action rather than  to the occurrence itself which means that the speaker has a defi - nite action in mind.  e.g. Where did your uncle receive his guests? Right here.  How did he get in? I asked and Evans said Oh he has a  key.  Where is my hat? Where did I leave my hat?  Note. The question Where have you been? can be asked of the perso n who has  just come.  e.g. Hello Mum. Im sorry Im late Where have you been?  In all other cases it should be Where were you! e.g. Did the party go off nicely? I dont know. I wasnt there. Where were  you? In special questions beginning with inte rrogative words other  than those mentioned above e.g. who what why what ... for and other both the Present Perfect and the Past Indefinite are possi - ble. The choice depends on the meaning to be conveyed. If refer - ence is made to an action which is past or definite in the minds of  the people speaking or if there is a change of scene the Past In - definite is used if reference is made to an action which is still  valid as part of the present situation the Present Perfect should  be used.  e.g. What  have I done against you? she burst out defiantly.  Nothing. Then why cant we get on?  I know she gave him a good scolding. What did he do?  Looking up at her he said Dorothys gone to a garden par - ty. I know. Why havent you gone too?  Why didnt you speak to my father yourself on the boat?  Note 1. As to general questions the Present Perfect as well as the Past Indefi  nite may be found in them because they may inquire either about new facts which  are important for the present or about events t hat are definite in the mind of the  speaker.  Note 2. In the following example the verb to be is used in the meaning to vis - it to go. Hence it takes the preposition to after it. It is noteworthy that to be ac- quires this meaning only if used in the P resent Perfect or the Past Perfect.  e.g. Renny said He has been to Ireland too  Have you been to a symphony concert? he continued.  Note 3. The combination hashave got may be used as the Present Perfect of  the verb to get which is not very common tho ugh.  e.g. I dont know whats got into Steven today.  He has got into financial difficulties and needs cash.  But it is often used as a set phrase which has two different meanings   to possess a and to be obliged b.  e.g. a Have you got a telephone ? she looked round the room.  I dont think weve got any choice said Francis  b No he said loudly there are some risks youve got to take.  It doesnt matter what caused it said Martin. We have got to take the  consequences  In this case the ti me reference also changes   hashave got is the Present Per - fect only in form it actually indicates a present state of things.  Note 4. She is gone is a survival of the old Present Perfect which was formed  with certain verbs by means of the auxiliary to be. In present -day English it is to be  treated as a set phrase meaning she is not here any longer.  2 Present Perfect II serves to express an action which began  before the moment of speaking and continues into it or up to it.  This grammatical meaning is m ainly expressed by the Present Per - fect Continuous see Verbs  18. However the Present Perfect  Non-Continuous is found in the following cases  a Its use is compulsory with stative verbs see Verbs 2 2. e.g. Ive known the young lady all her life. Ive loved her since she was a child.  But weve been in conference for two hours he said. Its  time we had a tea break.  b With some dynamic verbs of durative meaning the Present  Perfect is sometimes used instead of the Present Perfect Continu - ous with little difference in meaning.  e.g. Its a pretty room isnt it? Ive slept in it for fifteen  years.  Im glad to meet you he said. Ive waited a long while and  began to be afraid Id not have the opportunity.  Hes looked after Miss Gregg for many years now.  As to terminative verbs they can only have the meaning of  Present Perfect I and never of Present Perfect II.  Since it is often difficult to draw the line between durative and  terminative verbs it is recommended that students of Englis h should use the Present Perfect Continuous with all dynamic verbs  to express an action begun in the past and continued into the  present.  c The Present Perfect is preferred to the Present Perfect Con - tinuous in negative sentences when it is the action i tself that is  completely negated see also Verbs  19.  e.g. Shall we sit down a little? We havent sat here for ages.  I was just having a look at the paper he said. I havent  read the paper for the last two days.  She hasnt written to me for a year said Roy.  It is noteworthy that Present Perfect II is associated with cer - tain time indications   either the whole period of the duration of  the action is marked or its starting point. In the former case we  find different time indications. Some exp ressions are introduced  by the preposition for and sometimes in e.g. for an hour for  many years for the last few days for a long time for so long for  ages in years in a long while etc.- Other expressions have no  prepositions e.g. these three yea rs all this week all along so  long all oneys life etc..  e.g. The picture has been mine for years and years.  Ive felt differently about him for some time.  Why havent I seen you all these months? said Hankins.  We havent had any fun in a long whil e. Ive wanted to go to the sea all my life.  The starting point of the action is indicated by the adverb  since a prepositional phrase with since or a clause introduced by  the conjunction since.  e.g. But Dinny when did you meet him? Only ten days ago  but Ive seen him every day since.  The sun has been in the room since the morning.  But she has seemed so much better since you started the injec - tions.  In the clause introduced by since the Past Indefinite is used to  indicate the starting point of an ac tion see the example above.  However we sometimes find in both parts of such complex sen - tences two parallel actions which began at the same time in the  past and continue into the present. In this case the Present Perfect  is used in both clauses  e.g. I ve loved you since Ive known you.  It should be noted that the indication of time is indispensable to  Present Perfect II because otherwise its meaning in most cases  would be changed. It would come to denote an accomplished action  which is part of the pres ent situation for this see Present Perfect I.  Cf. Ive been taught to do it for three years.  I have been taught to do it.  But we met him here about a month ago. We havent heard  from him since.  We havent heard from him.  Care should be taken to distingui sh between the use of the  Present Perfect and the Past Indefinite when the period of dura - tion is expressed by a prepositional phrase with for. If the period of  duration belongs to the past time sphere the Past Indefinite should  be used. It is only if th e period of duration comes close to the mo - ment of speaking or includes it that the Present Perfect is used.  Cf. I have lived like this he said for two years and I cant  stand it any more.  I teach History at a secondary school. I went to the Univ ersi- ty here for four years and got a degree.  The same is true of questions beginning with how long.  Are you married? Yes. How long have you been mar - ried?  Are you married? No. Im divorced. How long were you  married?  3 Present Perfect III is found in adverbial clauses of time in - troduced by the conjunctions when before after as soon as till  and until where it is used to express a future action. It shows that  the action of the subordinate clause will be accomplished before  the action of  the principal clause which is usually expressed by  the Future Indefinite. This use of the Present Perfect is structur - ally dependent as it is restricted only to the above mentioned type  of clauses.  e.g. Youll find said Fred that youll long for h ome when you  have left it.  As soon as we have had some tea Ann we shall go to inspect  your house.  Ill take you back in my car but not till Ive made you some  coffee.  Sometimes the Present Indefinite is found in this type of claus - es in the same meanin g as the Present Perfect. The choice of the  form depends on the lexical meaning of the verb. With durative  verbs the Present Perfect is necessary.  e.g. When you have had your tea well see about it.  I can tell you whether the machine is good or bad when I  have tried it.  With terminative verbs the use of both forms is possible  Cf.   He says when he retires hell grow roses.  When Ive finished this I must go and put the baby to bed.  Mother will stay at home until we return.  Your mother wouldnt like me.  You cant possibly say that  until youve met her.  The Present Perfect Continuous   17. The Present Perfect Continuous is an analytical form  which is built up by means of the auxiliary verb to be in the  Present Perfect and the ing -form of the notional ver b e.g. I  have  been working. He has been working etc.. On the formation of  the ing-form see Verbs  11.  In the interrogative form the first auxiliary verb is placed be - fore the subject e.g. Have you been working? Has she been work - ing? etc.. In  the negative form the negative particle not is placed  after the first auxiliary e.g. We have not been working. They have  not been working etc.. In spoken English the contracted forms  Ive hes shes its weve youve and theyve are used in affir - mative sentences and hasnt and havent in negative sentences.   18. The Present Perfect Continuous falls within the time  sphere of the present. Hence it is not used in narration where refer - ence is made to past events. It is found in present -time contex ts i.e.  conversations newspaper and radio reports lectures and letters.  The Present Perfect Continuous has two uses which will be  further referred to as Present Perfect Continuous I and Present  Perfect Continuous II.  1 Present Perfect Continuous I serv es to express an action  which began before the moment of speaking and continues into it  or up to it. In this meaning it is parallel to Present Perfect II and  may be used with the same indications of time as described in  Verbs  16.  e.g. He said he was i n town and wanted to see me. That was a  couple of hours ago and I have been waiting ever since.  Weve been staying here nearly a week. I hope you are not  thinking of leaving. Her ladyship is waiting to see you and  Sergeant Cuff he said. How long has she been waiting?  I wish youd go Chris! Weve been getting on each others  nerves lately.  I have been thinking about it for a long time said Erik  frankly.  Ive been sitting here quite a while.  Hes your elder brother. But you are the one who looks after  him. Youve been making excuses for him all your life.  Present Perfect Continuous I may be used with both durative  and terminative verbs.  As has been said Present Perfect II can also be used in this  meaning with durative verbs though it is less co mmon see also  Verbs  16 2 and it is never used with terminative verbs.  It stands to reason that the Present Perfect Continuous is not  common with stative verbs.  2 Present Perfect Continuous II serves to express an action  which was in progress quite  recently and which in one way or an - other affects the present situation explains or gives reasons for  the state of things at the present moment.  The precise time limits of the action i.e. its beginning and its  end are not specified. This use of the Pr esent Perfect Continuous  seems to be prevailing over its use described under I. Besides in  this meaning the Present Perfect Continuous is not parallel to  Present Perfect II.  e.g. Your shoes are wet. Ive been walking in the rain.  She said Ive been talking to your boy -friend Adeline and  I like him.  Shes been washing her hair but it may be dry now.  He began abruptly Ive been thinking about what you told  me.  Dont tell your mother what Ive been saying.  He clasped the massive woollen underwear  against his chest.  Just what I need he declared. The moths have been  eating mine.  What have you been doing?  Then Phil called Ill be right down. Ive been shutting the  windows.  The Present Perfect Continuous in this case is as a rule not  associa ted with any indications of time see the examples above.  It is only occasionally found with indications of a recent period of  time or with the adverb just.  e.g. Augustus has been dining with us tonight.  I have been discussing it with Arabella this evenin g. Ive just been having such a delightful chat with Margaret.   19. In negative sentences the Present Perfect Continuous is  not common. Present Perfect II is preferred in this case for exam - ples see Verbs  16 2c. However the Present Perfect Cont inuous is also found in nega - tive sentences but in this case the negation does not refer to the  action itself but to the circumstances attending the action.  e.g. We dont wish to overtire the boys. A walk would only do  them good Jenny said. They hav ent been sleeping at all  well recently. which means that they have been sleeping  but their sleep has not been sound enough  Im sorry Im late. I hope you have not been waiting for me.  which means that I know you have been waiting but I hope  it is not for me   20. Present Perfect Continuous I and particularly Present  Perfect Continuous II are sometimes found with stative verbs.  e.g. Theres one thing Ive been meaning to ask you Miles Fred  said one afternoon.  Hello she said. Im glad youre hav ing lunch here. Ive  been wanting to talk to you.  Ive been noticing these changes in you ever since you got  that university degree.  A little break like this is what shes been needing all these  years.  Do you know Mr Nesfield? Oh yes. We have been see ing him every day.   21. Note the following sentence patterns  a He has been reading since he came.  b He has been reading since he has been working in the library.  In the first pattern the action in the subordinate clause intro - duced by since is expressed by  the Past Indefinite and serves to in - dicate only the starting point of the action in the principal clause.  In the second pattern the action of the subordinate clause is  parallel to that of the principal clause as they both began at the  same time in the p ast and continue into the moment of speaking.  In this case the Present Perfect Continuous is used .in both claus - es or Present Perfect II with stative verbs.  The Past Indefinite   22. The Past Indefinite is a synthetic form e.g. I  worked.  He sang. On the formation of the Past Indefinite see Verbs  ft 5 and Appendix. But the interrogative and negative forms are  built up analytically by means of the auxiliary verb to do in the  Past Indefinite and the infinitive of the notional verb without the  particle to e.g. Did you work? Did he work? We did not work.  She did not work. In spoken English the contracted form didnt  is used in negative sentences.  The Past Indefinite may have a special form which is used for  emphasis. This emphatic form is built up analytically by means of  the Past Indefinite of the auxiliary verb to do followed by the in - finitive of the notional verb without the particle to. The auxiliary  is heavily stressed in this case e.g. I  did insist on it. He did in - sist on it.   23.  The Past Indefinite is commonly used to express a past  action. It may be found in present -time contexts as well as in past - time contexts.  The Past Indefinite is used in the following cases  1 To express a single action which took place in the past. The  time of the action is often indicated. It is usually an indication of  the past time. Yet the Past Indefinite may also be found with such  adverbial modifiers of time as this morning today tonight etc. For details see also Verbs  16 1. e.g. Things came to a crisis in July.  My mother first heard of him when I was a mere child.  I only met her six months ago.  I had a letter from Willy yesterday.  Why I saw the announcement in the paper this morning.  The time of the action may be implied in the situatio n through  the mention of the place of the action or other attending circum - stances.  e.g. I ate turnips in Germany.  Did you belong to any society at the University?  What a lot you know said Miss Marple about the private  lives of film stars. Did you le arn it all in California?  Croft informed us at breakfast that you told him to bring  Mrs Warren and Vivie over here today.  He built that place for Lord Henry.  But sometimes the mention of the time or the place of the ac - tion appears unnecessary because r eference is made to a particular  action which is definite in the mind of the speaker and the hearer  see also Verbs  16 1.  e.g. Sorry! I didnt mean to hurt you.  I slept very badly.  You told it beautifully Grace.  Did he say anything? I didnt qui te catch what he said.  The definiteness of the action in the mind of the speaker is to  be regarded as the most prominent feature of this use of the Past  Indefinite. It becomes particularly obvious when compared with  the use of Present Perfect I see Verb s  16 1. 2 To express an action which occupied a whole period of time  now over. That means that the action after taking place for some  time came to an end in the past. Compare with the use of Present  Perfect II. See Verbs  16 2. The period of time is usually in - dicated in the sentence by means of adverbial phrases with the  prepositions for or during and synonymous expressions.  e.g. I admit I was wrong. Remember how we quarrelled about it?  We quarrelled for three days.  Last May I spent two week s in London.  We stayed in the garden for a long time.  For twenty years you lived without your child without a  thought of your child.  Note. Questions beginning with how long may accordingly contain either the  Past Indefinite or Present Perfect II depending  on whether the period of time im - plied is already over or has not yet expired  e.g. Maurice turned on the light and saw his brother sitting in the armchair. How  long have you been here? he asked in surprise.  We really had a wonderful time in Brighton.  How long did you stay there?  3 In narration to express a succession of actions.  e.g. So I went up the stairs. I bathed. I changed. I made myself  up like the Queen of Sheba. Then I went downstairs and  cooked and served dinner for three. Then I enterta ined Mr  Stent. Then I wished him a very good night. Then I wished  Jack good -bye. Then I took my suit -case and walked out.  We went to the park and I sat down on a chair and took the  baby out of the pram and a big dog came along and put its  head on my knee a nd she clutched its ear tugged it.  I found some matches climbed on the table lit the gas lamp  then settled down to read.  Consecutive actions may be either single accomplished actions  as in the examples above or actions of some duration occupying  a wh ole period of time. The latter is usually indicated in the sen - tence by means of prepositional phrases with for during from ... to or by means of the words all day all night and the like.  e.g. She looked at him for a long time and then shrugged.  We ma rched all night and all today. We arrived only an  hour ago.  4 To express recurrent actions. As this meaning is not inher - ent in the form as such it is generally supported by the use of  adverbial modifiers of frequency such as often never now and  again  sometimes for days etc. e.g. You often mentioned her in your letters.  But sometimes he found his work difficult.  Martin spent many of his evenings reading case histories of  radiation illness.  5 To express permanent actions which indicate continuous  uninterrupted processes in the past giving a general characteris - tic of the person or thing denoted by the subject.  e.g. She had a large blunt knobby nose and her eyes protruded  they were light blue staring and slightly puzzled. She  wore her hair in a knob above the back of her head.  Dan worked in a factory twelve hours a day for nine shillings  a week.  The drive sloped downward to where the house stood.  She lived alone in London and saw no one except me.  I knew they loved each other but they always quarrelled.  Note. In English there are special means of expressing a recurrent or perma - nent action in the past. They are used to  infinitive and would  infinitive. Used  pronounced just to   infinitive has only one form   that of the past tense  which occurs in present -time- and past -time contexts. It generally serves to expres  recurrent actions which may be either point actions or actions of some duration.  e.g. She used to give me chocolate murmured Imogen.  I used to meet him sometimes when he  was working on the Chronicle here.  I liked reading in the garden. I used to take out a deck -chair sit under one of  the apple -trees and read.  Sometimes used to  infinitive with a durative verb serves to express an ac  tion giving a permanent characteristi c of the subject of the sentence in the past. In.  this case it implies contrast between the past and the present   what was typical  of the past is no longer true at present. This meaning is naturally found in  present -time contexts.  e.g. I used to be as s entimental as anyone a few years ago said Ann.  You wouldnt have the same comforts in the country dear I know. I used to  live there as a girl.  I dont exactly hear as I used to.  The negative and interrogative forms of used to  infinitive are very seld om found and there is fluctuation in the way they are built up.  e.g. Lena didnt use to like the clock did she?  Im not mean. You usednt to be. But you have been lately havent you?  Cedric whats come over you? You used not to talk like that.  And what did they use to give you on Sundays? he was asking as I came in.  Who do writers write for now? Who did they use to write for? People of  course.  Used you to climb the old apple -tree in the garden?  It is necessary to point out that occasionally used to  infinitive is found  where normally the Past Perfect would be used.  e.g. He ordered dinner and sat down in the very corner at the very table perhaps  at which he and young Jolyon used to sit twenty -five years ago.  Would  infinitive is more restri cted in its application than used to  infini  tive. It is found only in past -time contexts and serves to express only recurrent ac - tions. On the whole would  infinitive is typical of literary style.  e.g. She would often wake up screaming in the night.  She seemed able to do nothing for an infinite time without feeling bored.  Sometimes I would go out and sit with her for a little on the grass.  He was usually active and interested but sometimes he would have fits of  depression.  6 To express an action goin g on at a given past moment. Gener - ally this meaning is rendered by the Past Continuous see Verbs   26. But we resort to the Past Indefinite in the following cases  a The use of the Past Indefinite becomes obligatory with stat - live verbs.  e.g. She  sipped her coffee and pulled a face. She thought it tasted  horrible.  She was ill at ease and he felt sorry for her. He wanted all  her troubles for himself at that moment.  b The Past Indefinite may be used instead of the Past Continu - ous with certain du rative verbs. They are to sit to stand to lie to  hang to shine to gleam to talk to speak to wear to carry to  walk and some others. In such cases the action as such is only  named and it is often the circumstances under which it takes  place that a re really important.  e.g. Barbara and Basil sat in the garden after lunch. The smoke  from Basils cigar hung on the humid air.  The lights in the house were out but a rising moon gleamed  against one window in the room where little Mary slept.  We went to th e bus stop. The full moon shone down on the  lightless blind -faced street.  His hair was newly cut he wore a stiff white collar a bowler  hat a thin gold watch -chain and other marks of respect - ability and he carried a new umbrella.  He talked with acute i ntensity.  Her face was heavy she spoke with deep emotion.  He walked between us listening attentively to our conversation.  Note. Note that when we speak of inanimate things the Past Indefinite is the  norm with the verbs mentioned above.  e.g. On the table lay three rows of cards face upwards.  Outside beyond the colonnade the ground froze hard and the trees stood out  white against the leaden sky.  7 To express a future action viewed from the past. This use is  found in reported speech and is structurally de pendent. It occurs in  clauses of time condition and concession the Future -in-the-Past or  modal verbs are usually used in the principal clause in this case.  For conjunctions introducing these clauses see Verbs1  10 4. e.g. He knew that she was dete rmined to marry him and would if  she thought it useful lie and cheat and steal until she  brought it off.  Probably she knew that whatever happened he would not  give her away.  8 To express unreal actions. For this see Verbs  122- 126 132 133 144 146 -149 153 162.   24. For the use of the Past Indefinite in some sentence pat - terns comprising complex sentences with clauses of time intro - duced by as and while see Verbs  28.  For the use of the Past Indefinite in some sentence patterns  comprising complex sentences with clauses of time introduced by  when after before tilluntil since etc. see Verbs  32.  The Past Continuous   25. The Past Continuous is an analytical form which is built  up by means of the auxiliary verb to be in the P ast Indefinite and  the ing -form of the notional verb e.g. I  was working. They were  working etc.. On the formation of the ing-form see Verbs   11. The same auxiliary is used in the interrogative and negative  forms e.g. Were you working? Was he work ing? We were not work - ing. I was not working etc.. In spoken English the contracted  forms wasnt and werent are used in negative sentences.   26. The Past Continuous is used in the following cases  1 To express an action which was going on at a given moment  in the past. The most typical feature of this use of the Past Con - tinuous is that the precise time limits of the action are not  known its beginning and its end are not specified.  As a rule no indication of a given past moment is necessary  because  the meaning is clearly expressed by the Past Continuous  itself. However sometimes it becomes important to mention the  moment and then it is indicated in the sentence by stating the pre - cise time or with the help of another action which is usually a  poin t action expressed in the Past Indefinite.  e.g. Little Mary came in. She was eating an ice -cream cone.  Jollys face crimsoned then clouded. Some struggle was evi - dently taking place in him.  I am afraid I took your wifes fan for my own when I was  leavi ng your house tonight.  In a moment I returned to where Martin was still reading by  the fire.  Note. As has been said the Past Indefinite is preferred to the Past Continuous  with certain durative verbs when attention is focused on the circumstances under  which the action is performed see Verbs  23 6 b. However the Past Continu - ous is occasionally found too.  e.g. She was speaking with difficulty as though she had to think hard about each  word.  Yet when it is intended to make the process of the acti on indicated by a dura - tive verb the focus of communication the use of the Past Continuous becomes  necessary. Compare the use of the Past Indefinite and the Past Continuous in the  following passage  On one occasion I sat with them in the studio. Dirk a nd I were talking. Mrs  Stroeve sewed and I thought I recognized the shirt she was mending as Strick - lands. He lay on his back. He did not speak.  2 To express an action going on at a given period of time in  the past. In this case the precise limits of t he action are not  known either. The indication of the past period of time is general - ly understood from the context but it may also be indicated in the  sentence in various ways.  e.g. Andrew had no idea whether he was doing well or badly in his  exam.  In th e slight pause young Nicholas was heard saying gently  that Violet was taking lessons in pastel.  He remembered that Helen had met her first husband when  she was working in a New York publishing house.  What were you doing in Paris? I was trying to find a pub- lisher for my new book.  Wake was in New York when the news reached him. He was acting in a play that had had a success in London.  Note. The Past Continuous may be used in present -time contexts to refer to a  past action whose duration is marked by suc h time indications as all day all that  year yesterday the whole morning and the like.  e.g. All through that winter and spring I was attending committees preparing  notes for the minister reading memoranda talking to my scientific friends.  Roy was kee ping to his rooms all day.  All that winter they were experimenting with protective clothing.  However this use of the Past Continuous is greatly restricted because it can be  applied only to a single action which is never part of a succession of actions. B ut even in this case the Past Indefinite is usually found.  e.g. I stayed in all day.  But most commonly such actions are expressed with the help of the sentence  pattern to spend time   ing form.  e.g. I spent all the morning reading.  He spent the summer hel ping his uncle on the farm.  3 To express actions characterizing the person denoted by the  subject i.e. bringing out the persons typical traits. Often such  adverbial modifiers as always and constantly are found in this case  in the sentence.  e.g. This is  Dans breakfast Adeline said indicating it with a  bandaged thumb. She was always suffering from a cut or a  burn.  You remember how he was always writing verses.  He was always experimenting. He wasnt really a doctor he  was a bacteriologist.  She was noi sy and brash and constantly trying to attract at - tention by any means.  The Past Continuous in this case imparts a subjective emotion - ally coloured tone. When no emotional colouring is implied the  Past Indefinite is used to give an objective characteris tic see also  Verbs  25.  4 To indicate a future action viewed from the past. It is an  action which was supposed to take place in the near future due to  ones previous decision. The time of the action need not always be  mentioned as it is easily under stood from the situation.  e.g. Why didnt you tell me you were starting?  He did not know how he could send word that he was not  coming.  At the end of the week she wired that she was returning.   27. It should be remembered that there are the same restric - tions to the use of the Past Continuous as to the Present Continu - ous in so far as the lexical character of verbs is concerned see  Verbs  2 2. Like the Present Continuous the Past Continuous may some - times be found with stative verbs. It occurs either because the  verb has changed its meaning or because the action is lent great  intensity.  e.g. I had a horrid feeling that she was seeing right through me  and knowing all about me.  I was seeing George regularly now. He took me as an equal.  The next mo rning as I was going out of the college I met the  Master in the court. I was wanting to catch you Eliot  he said.  I wasnt well that day and I wasnt noticing particularly.  He felt he was being the little ray of sunshine about the home  and making a g ood impression.  Some durative verbs for example verbs of bodily sensation to feel to hurt to ache to itch etc. and such verbs as to wear to look   to seem to shine and others may be used either in the Past In - definite or in the Past Continuous  with little difference in meaning.  Cf.   He was happy now that his wife was feeling better.  I saw that he felt upset.  Ted Newton stopped at my table for a quick drink. He was  wearing a fur coat.  A few minutes later Fred came from the direction of the sta - bles. He wore riding breeches.  His wife was looking happy.  She looked like a very wise mermaid rising out of the sea.   28. Note the following sentence patterns in which we find  the Past Indefinite and the Past Continuous used in different  combinations wi th each other  1 A complex sentence with a clause of time introduced by the  conjunction as. Within that pattern there may be three different  kinds of time relations between the action of the subordinate  clause and that of the principal clause.  a The acti ons of the two clauses are fully simultaneous. In this  case the Past Indefinite is commonly found in both clauses.  e.g. I watched him as he drank his tea.  Roy talked little as they drove home.  Occasionally the Past Continuous is found in the principal cla use whereas the Past Indefinite is still used in the clause of time. It usu - ally happens when the verb in the principal clause is terminative and  the Past Indefinite would indicate a completed action.  e.g. As I poured her out a glass of sherry she was sa ying I al - ways imagined you were older.  b The actions of the principal and the subordinate clauses are  partially simultaneous. In this case the action of the subordinate  clause serves as a background for the action of the principal clause  which is usu ally a shorter accomplished action. In this case we  normally find the Past Continuous in the subordinate clause and  the Past Indefinite in the principal clause.  e.g. As I was going inside Mrs Drawbell intercepted me.  One evening just as I was leaving the  office Martin rang  me up. c The actions of the two clauses form a succession. In this  case naturally only the Past Indefinite is found.  e.g. As the sun disappeared a fresh breeze stirred the new cur - tains at the window.  As I turned back into the roo m a gust of wind crashed the  door shut behind me.  2 A complex sentence with a clause of time introduced by the conjunction while. Here we find two different kinds of time  relations between the actions of the two clauses.  a The actions are fully simultane ous. In this case either the  Past Continuous or the Past Indefinite is used in the subordinate  clause and the Past Indefinite is normally found in the principal  clause  e.g. Martha said nothing but looked from one face to the other  while they discussed pla ns. She sat still as a statue while he was playing the sonata.  b The actions are partially simultaneous. In this case the ac - tion of the subordinate clause serves as a background for the action  of the principal clause which is a shorter accomplished acti on. So  the Past Indefinite is used in the principal clause while in the  subordinate clause either the Past Indefinite or the Past Continu - ous is found.  e.g. While I was reading I heard a splash from the bath and I  realized that Martin must be there.  While he stood there wondering what sort of pictures to hang  on the walls he heard the telephone ring.  The Past Perfect   29. The Past Perfect is an analytical form which is built up  by means of the auxiliary verb to have in the Past Indefinite and  the parti ciple of the notional verb e.g. I  had worked. He had  worked etc.. On the formation of the participle see Verbs  5 and Appendix. The same auxiliary is used to form the interrogative  and the negative forms e.g. Had you worked? Had he worked? It  had not worked. They had not worked. In spoken English the con - tracted forms Id hed shed wed youd theyd are used in af - firmative sentences and hadnt in negative sentences.   30. The Past Perfect falls within the time sphere of the past  and is m ainly found in narration. However as will be seen it may  be used in some of its meanings in present -time contexts as well.  The Past Perfect has three distinct uses which will be further re - ferred to as Past Perfect I Past Perfect II and Past Perfect III. 1 Past Perfect I serves to express an action accomplished be - fore a given past moment and viewed back from that past moment.  It may be a single point action an action of some duration or a re - current action.  We often find this use of the Past Perfec t in narration when a  string of consecutive actions is broken up because it becomes nec - essary to refer back to a previously accomplished action. It is the  function of the Past Perfect to mark this step back in narration.  e.g. She was no fool. She had read much in several languages and  she could talk of the books she had read with good sense.  It was long afterwards that I found out what had happened.  He knew where Haviland lived but he had never been there.  She mentioned not infrequently the fact that her grandfather  had been an ambassador but never that he had been a stable -boy.  She was in a dressing -gown and her hair was dishevelled. She  had evidently just got out of bed.  As is seen from the above example Past Perfect I is struc - turally independent  and may be used in simple sentences as well as  in various kinds of clauses.  Note. The time of the action expressed by the Past Perfect need not be indi - cated as the form itself shows that the action is accomplished before a given past  moment. Yet there m ay be indications of time if necessary.  e.g. Jolyon remembered that he also had talked a good deal about it in his first  year at Cambridge and given it up in his second.  They were concerned with why the machine had not run the day before.  Sometimes the st ep back which is made in narration refers to  one single action which is then expressed by the Past Perfect see  the examples above. Often however the step back in narration  involves a whole situation comprising a number of actions. These  actions may for m a new succession of actions. In this case the Past  Perfect may be used for all the actions a or for the first action  alone. The other actions are then expressed by the Past Indefinite  b. There seem to be no hard and fast rules here.  e.g. a Adeline w as selecting a book from the shelves. When she  had first come to the place there had been few books  there. To these she had added many volumes of poetry  old and new novels works of philosophy history es - says. It had been necessary to build new shelve s to ac - commodate the books she had collected.  He told her that he had recently recovered from an attack  of typhoid and had come to Switzerland to get back his  strength.  b It was at Blackstable that I first met Edward. I was fifteen  and had just come back from school for the summer hol - idays. The morning after I got home I took a towel and  bathing drawers and went down to the beach. Passing  the bank I called in to say how -do-you-do to the man - ager and when I came out I met my uncle. He stopped  and shook hands with me. He was walking with a strang - er. He introduced me to him.  2 Past Perfect II serves to express an action which began be - fore a given past moment and continues into it or up to it. This  grammatical meaning is mainly expressed by the Pas t Perfect Con - tinuous see Verbs  34. However the Past Perfect Non -Contin - uous is found in the following cases  a With stative verbs where its use is compulsory.  e.g. She began to do all the things that she had wanted to do for years.  He suddenly understood that she had loved him all her life.  b With some dynamic verbs of durative meaning where the  Past Perfect Non -Continuous may be used instead of the Past  Perfect Continuous with little difference in meaning.  e.g. Roy mentioned that he had dine d at home since his return.  June had never before been in the upper boxes. From the age  of fifteen she had habitually accompanied her grandfather  to the stalls.  As to terminative verbs they normally have the meaning of  Past Perfect I and never of Past Per fect II.  Since it is often difficult to draw the line between durative  and terminative verbs it is recommended that students of English  should use the Past Perfect Continuous with all dynamic verbs to  express an action begun before a given past moment and  continued  up to it or into it.  c In negative sentences when the action itself is completely  negated Past Perfect II is preferred to the Past Perfect Con - tinuous.  e.g. Young Jolyon and Soames had not met since the day of Bosin - neys death.  He mentione d that he had not played cards for three years.  Past Perfect II is associated with certain time indications ei - ther a whole period of the duration of the action is indicated or  its starting point for details see Verbs  16 2. e.g. I suppose every family has a black sheep. Tom had been a  sore trial to his for twenty years.  He was not aware how long he had sat there.  At ten oclock he awoke and remembered that he hadnt seen  Lily since Saturday.  He told me he had been badly ill since he returned from  abroad.  Note. Note that in clauses of time introduced by Since the Past Indefinite is  commonly used see the example above.  3 In adverbial clauses of time introduced by the conjunctions  when before after as soon as and tilluntil to express a future  action viewed from the past. It shows that the action of the sub - ordinate clause will be completed before the action of the princi - pal clause which is usually expressed by the Future -in-the-Past.  This use of the Past Perfect is structurally dependent as it is restricted only to the above -mentioned type of clauses. Besides it  is found only in reported speech.  e.g. It was desperately early he took up his book again making  up his mind that he would not look at his watch till he had read thirty pages.  You would have to talk to him before he had made up his  mind.  4 To express unreal actions. For this see Verbs  122 - 126 132 -133 144 146 -149 153 162.   31. As has been said above the Past Perfect is usually found  in past -time contexts see the exa mples above. However it may  also be used in present -time contexts in its various meanings. Yet  even in this case its use is related not to the moment of speaking  but to a definite past moment expressed or understood from the  context or situation.  e.g. W e only learned about it before dinner said Muriel. We  had not expected anything so fantastic.  Roy hesitated. I dont know whether Mother has told you.  Grace he said but a friend of mine is arriving today.1 Yes I had heard said Grace.  Did yo u know the average housewife walks ten miles a day  about the house? I heard so on the radio today. I hadnt  thought about it he said.   32. Note the following sentence patterns in which the Past  Perfect is or may be used  1 In a simple sentence or in two co -ordinate sentences the Past  Perfect is often used in combination with the Past Continuous  when both actions are viewed from the same past moment. The  definite moment need not be indicated in this case as the pattern  itself shows that the actions are  related to the same past moment.  One action is accomplished before that implied moment while the  other one is still in progress. This pattern is very widely used.  e.g. Ann had risen and was peering over his shoulder.  She had got up and was breathing deep ly with her lips part - ed and her cheeks very flushed.  All along the walls people were standing and at the far end of  the square boys had climbed into the trees.  As he went down the stairs I walked across to my window and  pulled the curtains. The sky had cleared and the moon was  shining on the snow.  With stative verbs and with some dynamic verbs of durative  meaning the Past Indefinite is used instead of the Past Continuous  in this pattern.  e.g. The rain had passed and the air was fresh and sweet.  She had c hanged her wet clothes and wore a light cotton dress.  2 In a complex sentence with a subordinate clause of time in - troduced by the conjunction when. The time relations between the  action of the when -clause and that of the principal clause may be  of vario us kinds the action of the principal clause may follow the  action of the when -clause be fully or partially simultaneous with  it and even occasionally precede it. Accordingly different finite  forms are used in the principal and the subordinate clauses  a The most commonly occurring kind of time relation is when  the action of the principal clause closely follows that of the when - clause   the two actions form a succession of actions. The Past  Indefinite is usually used in both clauses in this case.  e.g. When they reached Grosvenor Square Angela got out of the  taxi and looked about her puzzled.  When she returned with the grammar she drew a chair near  his and sat down beside him.  Yet sometimes with the same time relation between the two  actions we fin d the Past Perfect in the when -clause. It is used in  this case to emphasize the completion of the action in the subordi - nate clause and the when -clause then is close in meaning to that  of the clause of time introduced by the conjunction after see fur - ther below p. 55. e.g. When they had shown him round fed him on their best and  thrust him into their softest chair they eagerly demanded  news.  In a moment the butler came in to clear up. When he had left  again she said Your servant is an honest man  isnt he?  b When the two actions are partially simultaneous the Past  Continuous is usually found in the principal clause and the Past  Indefinite in the when -clause. The former represents the action in  its duration. The latter indicates a shorter action  which occurs at  a certain moment of the development of the action in the princi - pal clause.  e.g. Later that night I was reading in my sitting -room when the bell rang.  When he returned to the room she was sitting by the fire.  With stative verbs and some dynamic verbs of durative mean  ing the same time relation is expressed by the Past Indefinite in  the principal clause.  e.g. He was still in a state of uncertainty when his brother re- turned with a letter in his hand.  When the car stopped in front of the door he looked dazed.  c When the two actions are fully simultaneous the Past In - definite is generally used in both clauses.  e.g. Ann Chester looked her best when she smiled.  I often felt sincere admiration when I talked to him.  Note. The same time rela tions as described under a b and c may be found  in this sentence pattern when the Past Perfect has to be used in the principal  clause to mark a step back in narration whereas the Past Indefinite remains un - changed in the when -clause.  e.g. My friend ship with Roy became the deepest of my life. I had met him first  when he was a boy of fifteen.  Ashenden remembered the iron grip he had given him when they shook hands  and slightly shuddered.  d Occasionally the action of the principal clause may precede  that of the subordinate clause. In this case the Past Perfect is used  in the principal clause and the Past Indefinite in the when -clause.  e.g. He walked at my side under the trees by the edge of the park. When he next spoke his tone had changed.  When he returned to the living -room his wife hadnt moved  and the radio continued to play into the silence.  3 In a complex sentence with a when -clause containing the  Past Indefinite in the subordinate clause and the negative form of  the Past Perfect in the princip al clause.  e.g. I hadnt been in the pub two minutes when somebody brought  Tom in for a drink.  I hadnt gone a hundred yards from the corner when I noticed  there was a car behind me.  Note that there is always some indication of measure men - tioned in the p rincipal clause. Sentences  of this kind  are generally  rendered  in Russian  as            ...       ... .  4 In a complex sentence with a subordinate clause of time in - troduced by the conjunction as soon as when the action of the principal clause closely follows that of the subordinate clause. The  two actions form a kind of a succession of actions. Hence the Past  Indefinite is normally used in both parts of the sentence.  e.g. As soon as I had the chance I asked Mary -Ann what she knew  of the incident.  As soon as she arrived i n my flat she busied herself tidying  it up.  Occasionally the Past Perfect may be found in the subordinate  clause where it is used to emphasize the completion of the action  and then the meaning of the subordinate clause is close to that of  the subordinate  clause of time introduced by the conjunction after  see below.  e.g. As soon as he had gone I spoke to Hanna.  5 In a complex sentence with a subordinate clause of time intro  duced by the conjunction after the action of the principal clause  follows tha t of the after -clause. Generally the Past Perfect is found  in the after -clause and the Past Indefinite in the principal clause.  e.g. After I had dressed I went up to Roys room and found him  in shirt -sleeves and black waistcoat studying his image in  the mirror.  After he had been through the grammar repeatedly he took  up the dictionary and added twenty words a day to his vo - cabulary.  The Past Perfect is used in the after -clause with terminative as  well as durative verbs. With terminative verbs however  the Past  Perfect may be replaced by the Past Indefinite.  e.g. Shortly after we returned from Basel Roy moved to London  After we rose from the table James immediately went to  make a telephone call.  6 In a complex sentence with a subordinate clause of t ime in - troduced by the conjunctions till or until when the action of the  principal clause is an action of some duration and precedes that of  the subordinate clause. Usually the Past Indefinite is found in  both the principal and the subordinate clause.  e.g. He read the manuscripts until he was dead tired.  I did not see him again till he returned to England for the  summer.  Sometimes however the Past Perfect is used in the tilluntil  clause to show that the action of the principal clause stopped only  after the action of the subordinate clause was accomplished.  e.g. That evening I took out a deck -chair sat under one of the  apple -trees and read until the summer sky had darkened  and I could not make out the print.  He waited till she had regained a certain cal m. 7 In a complex sentence with a subordinate clause of time in - troduced by the conjunction before in which there may be two  kinds of time relations between the two actions  a The action of the principal clause precedes that of the be fore-clause . Hence the Past Perfect is found in the principal  clause and the Past Indefinite in the subordinate clause.  e.g. Madge had given Dace a set of keys before they left the farm  on Wednesday morning.  He had heard the news before he ran up my stairs.  Sentences of  this kind are rendered in Russian by means of    ...   ..     ... . Actually however the Past Indefinite is by far more common  in the principal clause especially with terminative verbs.  e.g. He knocked at the door twice before a muffled voice asked  Whos there?  It hap pened before you came.  b The action of one of the clauses is not fully accomplished  before the action of the other clause occurs. The unaccomplished  action is expressed by the Past Perfect. Sometimes there are indi - cations of measure in such sentences.  If the unaccomplished action is expressed in the principal  clause its predicate verb is always negative in form.  e.g. They had not gone four miles before he understood that it  was going to rain.  He had not been there for two days before he admitted that  he should not have accepted the invitation.  Sentences of this kind are best rendered in Russian as   -  ...       ...  etc. If the unaccomplished action is expressed in the subordinate  clause its predicate verb is affirmative in  form but negative in  meaning.  e.g. I realized before you had been here a fortnight that you nev - er were cut for this life.  I discovered the news before I had been in the house for an  hour.  Sentences of this kind are generally rendered in Russian as       ...           ...  etc. 8 In a complex sentence with a subordinate clause of time in - troduced by the correlatives scarcely... when hardly... when near  ly...  when and no sooner... than the time relation betwe en the  two actions is of a specific character   the action of the subordi - nate clause takes place when the action of the principal clause is  hardly accomplished yet. Hence the Past Perfect is found in the  principal clause and the Past Indefinite in the s ubordinate clause.  Such sentences are emphatic in meaning and scarcely hardly and no sooner may be placed at the head of the sentence with an in - verted word order following.  e.g. He had scarcely entered the room when in a chair by the door  he perceived A nn Chester.  She had hardly sat down when a very stout gentleman wear - ing a very small hat flopped into the chair opposite hers.  No sooner however had they established themselves in the  house than he perceived to his dismay a return of her  gloomy mood.  Note. When scarcely hardly and nearly are used as adverbs and not as correla  tives they may be associated with different finite forms whose choice is determined  by the situation.  e.g. He did not hate her he scarcely seemed aware of her presence.  I hardly  know what to say. The Past Perfect Continuous   33. The Past Perfect Continuous is an analytical form which  is built up by means of the auxiliary verb to be in the Past Perfect  and the ing-form  of the notional verb e.g.  had been working. He  had been w orking etc.. On the formation of the ing -form see Verbs 11.  In the interrogative form the first auxiliary verb is placed be  fore the subject e.g. Had you been working? Had she been work  ing? etc.. In the negative form the negative particle not i s placed  after the first auxiliary e.g. We had not been working. They had  not been working etc.. In spoken English the contracted forms  Id hed shed wed youd theyd are used in affirmative and  hadnt in negative sentences.   34. The Past Perfe ct Continuous has two different uses  which will be further referred to as Past Perfect Continuous I  and Past Perfect Continuous II.  1 Past Perfect Continuous I serves to express an action which  began before a given past moment and continued into it or up to it. In this meaning it is parallel to Past Perfect II see Verbs   30 2. Past Perfect Continuous I may be used with the same in - dications of time as are already described in Verbs  16 2. e.g. She suddenly realized that it was now completely d ark and  that she had been walking for a long while.  He knew what she had been thinking about since she re - ceived the telegram.  Grant Melville was charming and quite a famous painter. He  had been coming to North Cornwall for years he had a  shack up in th e hills.  Ashenden assembled the observations that he had been mak - ing for the past few days.  The Past Perfect Continuous can be used with dynamic verbs  of both durative and terminative meaning see the examples  above. Stative verbs express this meaning w ith the help of Past  Perfect II see Verbs  30 2. Past Perfect II is possible with  dynamic verbs of durative meaning but it is not found at all with  terminative verbs.  2 Past Perfect Continuous II serves to express an action  which was in progress ju st before a given past moment and it affects  the past situation in some way. The precise time limits of he action are not specified. In this meaning the Past Perfect Con - tinuous is not parallel to Past Perfect II.  Past Perfect Continuous II is as a rule  not associated with  any indications of time.  e.g. Winifred rose from the chair in which she had been sitting.  Adeline who had been helping her mother now joined them.  She and Sylvia talked in high excited tones about an antholo - gy of poetry they had be en reading.  Half -heartedly I asked what she had been thinking about.  Adeline came across the lawn to meet him carrying roses she  had been cutting.   35. In negative sentences the Past Perfect Continuous is not  common the Past Perfect Non -Continuous is  preferred in them  when the negation refers to the action itself but not to its circum  stances see also Verbs  19.  e.g. I knew they had not corresponded for years.   36. It is noteworthy that Past Perfect Continuous I and par - ticularly Past Perfect Continuous II may sometimes be found with  stative verbs.  e.g. Beside the porch he stopped to examine the web of a spider  which he had been noticing for a week or more.  Certainly the medicine had steadied her the sinking feeling  she had been having was all  gone.  Over tea she tried to find out whether I had been seeing Sheila.   37. Note some sentence patterns in which the Present Per - fect Continuous or the Past Perfect Continuous is found  1 In a complex sentence with a subordinate clause of time in - troduced by since whose action indicates the starting point of the  action in the principal clause. Hence the Past Indefinite is used in  the since -clause. As to the principal clause the Present Perfect  Continuous or Present Perfect II is used in it in pres ent-time  contexts a and the Past Perfect Continuous or Past Perfect II in  past-time contexts b.  e.g. a They are bombs. You could blow the roof of the whole of  this building with what Ive got here said the lunatic  Ive been carting them from roo m to room since the war began.  Ive known him since we were kids.  b Michael rose and clutched his hat. Wilfred had said exact  ly what he himself had really been thinking ever since  he came.  Mr Bentley was a publisher because ever since he was a  boy he ha d had a liking for books.  2 In a complex sentence with a subordinate clause of time in  troduced by the conjunctions while and since or by some connec - tive words and expressions such as as long as during the week in  the short time that all the time that etc. The actions in both  clauses may be parallel starting at the same time in the past and  continuing either into or up to the moment of speaking in present - time contexts a or into or up to a given past moment in past -time contexts b. Accordi ngly the Present Perfect Continuous or  Present Perfect II is used in both clauses in the former case and  the Past Perfect Continuous or Past Perfect II in the latter case.  e.g. a Our friendship has been growing all the time weve been  working on the project.  Ive been rather shut in since weve been here with all  this bad weather.  b We had been sitting on our beds while George had been  telling me this true story.  The suit had been neither pressed nor brushed since he had had it.  3 In a complex sent ence with a subordinate clause of time in - troduced by the conjunction when. The action of the subordinate  clause may serve to indicate a given past moment into or up to  which the action of the principal clause that had begun before  that moment continued . The duration of the action is indicated by  some adverbial modifier of time. Accordingly the Past Indefinite  is found in the when -clanse and the Past Perfect Continuous or  Past Perfect II in the principal clause. It should be noted that  this is a very commonly occurring pattern.  e.g. He had been sitting by the fire for nearly an hour when his mother came into the room with a letter in her hands.  They had been walking for less than an hour when the moon  suddenly appeared between the heavy clouds.  The Fut ure Indefinite   38. The Future Indefinite is an analytical form which is  built up by means of the auxiliary verbs shall for the first per - son singular and plural and will for the second and third per - sons singular and plural and the infinitive of the notional verb  without the particle to e.g.  shall see him tomorrow. He will see  them tomorrow. You will see them tomorrow etc..  It should be mentioned that in present -day English there is a ten - dency to use will for all the persons. Besides the  difference in the  use of shall and will disappears altogether in spoken English where  the contracted form  l1 is used with all the persons e.g. Ill see him  tomorrow. Shell see him tomorrow. Theyll see him tomorrow etc..  The auxiliary verbs shall and will are used to build up the in - terrogative and the negative forms too e.g. Shall we see you to - morrow? Will they see him tomorrow? I shall not see you tomor  row. You will not see me tomorrow etc..  In spoken English the contracted forms shant and wont are  commonly used in negative sentences.   39. The Future Indefinite is found only in present -time con - texts. It is by far the most common of all the finite forms refer - ring an action to the future. Although it is widely used in English  it is some what restricted in its application owing to a number of  reasons which will be dealt with below.  The Future Indefinite may be used to express  1 a single point action that will be completed in the future  e.g. It will ruin her.  I know Im right and one of  these days youll realize it.  2 an action occupying a whole period of time in the future  e.g. I think I shall remain in love with you all my life.  I hope youll live for many years.  3 a succession of actions in the future  e.g. I shall wait in the next  room and come back when shes gone.  Well just talk about the weather and the crops for a few  minutes and then well have dinner.  4 some recurrent actions in the future  e.g. I shall come along as often as possible.  I hope we shall see something of you w hile you are in London.  5 some permanent future actions generally characterizing the  person denoted by the subject of the sentence  e.g. Im afraid hell be a bit lonely poor darling.  The old age pension will keep me in bread tea and onions  and what mo re does an old man want?  The Future Continuous   40. The Future Continuous is an analytical form which is  built up by means of the auxiliary verb to be in the Future Indef - inite and the ing -form of the notional verb e.g.  shall be seeing  him often now.  He will be seeing them often now etc.. On the  formation of the Future Indefinite see Verbs  38 on the forma - tion of the ing-form see Verbs 11.  In the interrogative form the first auxiliary verb is placed be - fore the subject e.g. Shall I be  seeing him often now? Will he be  seeing them often now? etc.. In the negative form the negative  particle not is placed after the first auxiliary e.g.  shall not be  seeing him often now. He will not be seeing them often now etc..  In spoken English th e contracted form 11 is used with all the  persons in affirmative sentences and shant and wont in negative  sentences.   41. The Future Continuous is used in the following cases  1 To express an action in progress at a definite future moment.  The precise  time limits of the action are not specified and the fu - ture moment at which the action takes place is usually indicated  by an adverbial modifier or is clear from the context or situation.  e.g. Well just be beginning the experiments then and my con - tract here ends this summer.  Now I feel absolutely dopy. God knows what I shall be saying  in a minute.  However in present -day English this original meaning of the  Future Continuous is not so common since it is seldom required  by the situation.  2 To express an action which the speaker expects to take place  in the future in the natural course of events. It may be used with  or without time indications and generally refers to the near future  though it is also possible to use it for a more distant future.  e.g. I feel I shall be asking you the same question tomorrow.  Maurice is tired. He will be coming to bed directly.  You havent been out for a week his mother said. Five  days Vincent put down his paper. Youll be taking root  in that armchair. Your face is g rowing paler every day.  He yawned. Another five minutes and Ill be explaining the  law of gravity to another set of my pupils. Ill be making  the same old jokes and theyll be laughing at them in the  same old way.  Bob will not be coming. Hes been take n ill.  This use should be regarded as the main application of the Fu - ture Continuous in modern English.   42. Note the following examples in which the Future Contin - uous is used with stative verbs.  e.g. Whats your brother like? I shall be knowing him a t Ox - ford said Val.  Harris said We shall be wanting to start in less than twelve  hours time.  What sort of house has Laura? I didnt notice. I shant be  seeing her again in any case.  The Future Perfect   43. The Future Perfect is an analytical fo rm which is built  up by means of the auxiliary verb to have in the Future Indefi - nite and the participle of the notional verb e.g. I shall have read  the book by that time He will have read the book by that time  etc.. On the formation of the Future In definite see Verbs   38 on the formation of the participle see Verbs  5.  In the interrogative form the first auxiliary verb is placed be - fore the subject e.g. Will she have read the book by that time?  Will you have read the book by that time? etc.. In the negative  form the negative particle not is placed after the first auxiliary  e.g. We shall not have read the book by that time. They will not  have read the book by that time etc..  In spoken English the contracted form 11 is used with all th e persons in affirmative sentences and shant and wont in negative  sentences.   44. The Future Perfect is used to express an action accom - plished before a given future moment which is usually indicated  by an adverbial modifier.  e.g. I daresay youll hav e gone to bed by the time Ive finished.  I suppose we shall have made up our minds whom we are go - ing to elect before the meeting.  The Future Perfect is not used very often owing to the fact  that it is seldom required by the situation.  Different Means of Expressing Future Actions Compared   45. All future actions are by nature hypothetical. Owing to  that ways of expressing future actions   in addition to the mean - ing of futurity   are often associated with various other modal  meanings such as intention  willingness readiness obligation as - surance expectation and the like. That explains why English is  rich in means of referring an action to the future.   46. The following is a description of different means of ex - pressing future actions in present -day English! 1 The Present Continuous is used to express a future action as  definitely settled due to ones previous decision. The action is go - ing to take place in the near future and the time is as a rule indi - cated in the sentence by means of such adverbial modifiers as to- night next week in a few days etc. e.g. She is coming to lunch on Thursday.  You know Im going away tonight.  Are you staying  long?  Teddie is leaving here by the first train tomorrow.  Patrick are we doing anything at the wee kend?  This use of the Present Continuous is also possible without  any time indications and then the action refers to the immediate  future.  e.g. Its Fred. Hes going to Italy and wants to say good -bye. Im just going upstairs to change and pack.  Im sorry you are leaving England.  And now I must go as we are dining out.  Some of these forms can be regarded as purely grammatical ways of expressing  future actions others are on the border -line between lexical and grammatical means.  Note. Note that in questions  beginning with when the Present Continuous a  ways refers the action to the future.  e.g. When is he coming?  When are you going back?  When the Present Continuous is used to refer an action to the  future the action is regarded as fixed and the speaker is ce rtain  that it will take place.  With stative verbs the Future Indefinite should be applied to  refer an action to the future.  2 The Future Continuous is also one of the means of express  ing future actions. It is described in detail in Verbs  41.  The dif ference between the Present Continuous used to denote  a future action and the Future Continuous becomes quite evident  if we compare the following sentences  e.g. We are meeting tomorrow  we have arranged to meet tomor  row we have fixed the date of our m eeting.  We shall be meeting tomorrow  not because of some ar  rangement but in the normal course of events either be  cause we work together or because we attend classes togeth  er or regularly play some game at the same place and at  the same time etc. . 3 To be  infinitive with to like the Present Continuous  serves to indicate a previous arrangement but in addition to that  meaning it generally implies obligation resulting from that ar - rangement. Besides it differs from the Present Continuous i n that it does not necessarily refer the action to the near future.  The verb to be in this combination is regarded as a modal verb.  Since a previous arrangement is the basic meaning of this com - bination and the action always refers to the future no speci al indi  cation of time is needed in the sentence though the time may be  mentioned if necessary.  e.g. Ive had a letter from home. Im to go back at once.  This autumn he is entering the Military College. He is to  make the Army his career.  The meaning of ob ligation may become so strong that to be   infinitive sometimes expresses orders or instructions which are  to be carried out in the future.  e.g. Milly you are not to talk like that in front of the child.  4 To be going to  infinitive is an important m eans of refer - ring an action to the future which is frequently used in modern  English. It is convenient to refer to it as the going -to form.  The going -to form may have the following meanings  a It serves to express premeditated intention which means  that the person denoted by the subject has been planning for some  time to perform the action has been thinking of it that some  preparation for the action has been in progress. Indications of  time are optional in this case.  e.g. Im not going to live at h ome.  Im going to say something dreadful to you Dorothy.  Im going to tell him what I think of him.  Hes not going to make any concessions.  Are you going to play tennis?  What are you going to do about it?  Shes going to explain that tomorrow.  Oh Im not going to marry for years yet.  Note. The verb to go is actually not the Present Continuous here. It is the  Present Continuous only in form its use has become idiomatic in this combination.  Although this means of referring an action to the future is fre - quently found in English its application is somewhat restricted  it is mainly found with dynamic verbs. An important exception to  the rule however is the verb to be which often occurs in this  construction.  e.g. Hes going to be a solicitor.  Of course th e trips going - to be wonderful.  The verbs to go and to come are rarely found with the going - to form. Thus He is going to go or He is going to come are un - common in English. These verbs are generally used in the Present  Continuous instead.  e.g. Oh ar e you going to Italy?  re you coming Mother?  b It may also be used to show the speakers feeling that the  action is imminent that it is unavoidable in the near future. No  indication of time is generally needed in this case.  A e.g. I dont know what is g oing to happen.  The next few years said George are going to be a won - derful time to be alive.  Oh what is going to become of us?  Im afraid Im going to cry.  5 The Present Indefinite is also an important means of ex - pressing future actions. It is use d in four different cases which  have been described in Verbs  10 4. 6 The Future Indefinite. After all the other means of express - ing future actions have been described it is now necessary to see  what remains for the Future Indefinite proper to expres s. In the first place it should be pointed out that the Future In - definite is used differently with dynamic and stative verbs.  With stative verbs the Future Indefinite is used to express  any action referring to the future without any restrictions.  e.g. H is suggestion will interest you enormously.  Youll think his ideas absurd.  Shell know the truth soon.  Dont bother I shall manage all right by myself.  Dad will never consent to our marriage.  Itll be rather fun coming up to town to eat my dinners.  Ill b e back presently.  We shall have some news for you to take to your people.  It will not make much difference to me.  The other means of expressing future actions are not common  with stative verbs   some of them seem to be impossible with  these verbs e.g. the  Present Continuous the Future Continuous  partly the Present Indefinite while others are uncommon e.g. the  going -to form.  Although the number of stative verbs is limited they are in  frequent use which makes the role of the Future Indefinite very  important in English.  With dynamic verbs the Future Indefinite is used freely only  under certain conditions  a In the principal clause of a complex sentence with a clause of  time condition and concession. 1 1 In the subordinate clauses we find the Present  Indefinite or the Present Perfect  see Verbs  10 4 and  16 3.  e.g. We shall catch the train if we start now she insisted.  Youre the prettiest woman Ive ever known and I shall say  the same when youre a hundred.  As soon as we have had tea F red we shall go to inspect your  house.  Well talk about it whenever he comes.  Other means of expressing future actions are uncommon in  this case.  b In passive constructions.  e.g. Hell be voted down.  My chief will be informed of your request.  She will be  paid in cash.  c To express a succession of actions in the future. No other  means seems to be suitable here.  e.g. I shall prepare you a nice little dinner and then well leave  you. Ill take a walk to the sea and on my way back Ill buy you a  newspaper.  d When the time of the realization of the action is indefinite  or when its realization is remote.  e.g. We shall meet again one day.  Life will teach her a lesson.  Hell never sell his little cottage.  Such sentences often contain adverbial modifiers of indef inite  time e.g. always forever in future never some day and the like.  e To denote actions whose realization is uncertain doubtful  or merely supposed as their fulfilment depends on some implied  condition.  e.g. You mustnt cry. Please dont or I sh all go to pieces.  Protest as you like Mr   it wont alter my decision.  In this case we sometimes find such attitudinal adverbs in the  Sentence as perhaps probably of course and the like.  e..g. Theyll probably get a lot of satisfaction out of our qu arrel.  Of course he will send you a letter in a few days.  f In object clauses after verbs and their equivalents express - ing personal views or opinions such as to be afraid to believe to  be sure to doubt to expect to have no doubt to hope to im agine  to know to suppose to suspect to think to wonder and the like.  Sometimes these verbs are used in parenthesis.  e.g. He thinks a scandal will ruin his reputation.  I dont know what I shall do without you.  Im afraid he wont talk to you.  Ive no d oubt youll explain it perfectly.  His new novel is Im quite sure of it another masterpiece.  On the whole it should be noted that although other means of  expressing futurity can also be used under the conditions de - scribed above a b c d e f they  are applied when their mean - ing is specially required.   47. If dynamic verbs are used in the Future Indefinite under  conditions other than those described above the sentences become  modally coloured. This occurs owing to the fact that the auxilia - ries shall and will preserve their modal meanings.  Thus shall preserves its original meaning of obligation if  somewhat modified with the 2nd and 3rd persons in sentences ex - pressing promise threat or warning.  e.g. I promise you Arthur that Harold shant do anything about it.  He shall have a scandal. He shall have the worst scandal  there has been in London for years.  Shall also preserves its modal meaning when it is used in ask - ing after the will of the person addressed.  e.g. Shall I bring you some coffee ? Oh Alfred what shall we do?  Will in print will or ll is often used in affirmative sentences  with the first person singular and plural to express such mean - ings as wish willingness readiness intention determination to  perform an action.  e.g. 11 do what I can.  Ill go wherever you take me.  Will in sentences of this kind also shows that the speaker of - fers to perform an action.  e.g. Ill go and get a drink for you.  Ill wire to have the room ready for them.  Ill come with you Barbara.  In affir mative sentences will with the 2nd and 3rd persons  may occasionally express a command.  e.g. You will come here tomorrow not later than ten Mr Lickcheese.  Bernard will pay the taxi.  In negative sentences will expresses refusal to perform an ac - tion.  e.g. I wont argue with you.  He wont be ordered about.  In general questions direct and indirect as well as in disjunc - tive questions will also preserves its modal meaning and the in - terrogative sentence is actually to be understood as a request or  an invi tation.  e.g. Will you ask him to ring me back?  Youll wait for us wont you?  Oh ask him if he wont come in.  The same is true of complex sentences with an if -clause in  which will is used to express willingness or consent.  e.g. Oh but we shall be delight ed if youll lunch with us.  Will may express supposition.  e.g. As she entered the room the telephone rang. Thatll be your  mother Jenny said to her husband.  For a detailed treatment of the modal verbs shall and will see Verbs 105 113 -116.   48. By way of exception to the above rules dynamic verbs  m occasionally be found in the Future Indefinite to express  mere futurity without any additional modal meanings. This use of  the Future Indefinite may be understood as an expression of neu - trality or impartiality on the part of the speaker. Usually one  of the other means of expressing futurity is used in such cases.  e.g. I shall dine in my own room.  I shall leave you with your father for half an hour.  In this chapter we shall present a brief account of new meth - ods that we have used.  Be quiet. Somebod y will answer the bell.  This use of the Future Indefinite is found in formal announce - ments of future plans in newspapers and news broadcasts.  e.g. This is the weather forecast for the afternoon. A belt of de - pression will spread further north showers will fall in southern districts.  49. It stands to reason that sometimes the difference be - tween the various means of referring an action to the future may  become unimportant as the distinction is often very subtle. Thus  there are cases when two differen t forms may be used inter - changeably without any noticeable difference in meaning.  Cf. We are going to the pictures tonight.  We are to go to the pictures tonight.  He is taking his exam next week.  He will be taking his exam next week.  Im meeting Tom at th e station.  Im going to meet Tom at the station.   50. Note the use of the Future Indefinite in the following  stereotyped sentences  e.g. Ill ask you to excuse me.  Youll excuse me Gardner.  Well well see.  Itll do you good.  It wont do them harm to coo l their heads a bit.  Youve got a mind like a steel trap. Youll go far.  No good will come of it.  Means of Expressing Future Actions Viewed  from the Past   51. English has some special forms to express future actions if  they are viewed from some moment in  the past. The most common  of these means is the Future -in-the-Past which like the Future  has the following forms the Future Indefinite -in-the-Past the Future Continuous -in-the-Past and the Future Perfect -in-the-Past.  1 The Future Indefinite -in-the-Past is an analytical form  which is built up by means of the auxiliary verbs should for the  first person singular and plural and would for the second and  third persons singular and plural and the infinitive of the notion - al verb without the particle  to e.g.  said I should do it. I said he  would do it etc.. In present -day English there is a tendency to use  would for all the persons. Besides the difference in the use of  should and would disappears altogether in spoken English where  the contracted form d is used with all the persons e.g.  said Id  to it. I said hed do it etc.. In negative sentences the particle not  placed after the auxiliaries should and would with which it often  forms the contractions shouldnt and wouldnt e.g. I said I should  not shouldnt do it. I said he would not wouldnt do it etc..  The use of the Future Indefinite -in-the-Past is stru cturally de - pendent mainly found in object clauses after one of the past fi - mite forms in the principal clause. 1 e.g. At twenty I did not know whether any woman would love me with her whole heart.  I felt that further conversation with Dave would be unprofit - able at that moment.  He was sure I should get the job.  The Future Indefinite -in-the-Past expresses the time of the ac - tion relatively see Verbs  54 i.e. with regard to a given past  moment the action of the subordinate clause follows that of the Principal clause.  2 The Future Continuous -in-the-Past is an analytical form  which is built up by means of the auxiliary verb to be in the Fu - ture Indefinite -in-the-Past and the ing-form of the notional verb   1 It can be used in all types of clauses i n which the rules of the sequence of tenses  are observed.  e.g.  said I should be seeing him often soon. I said he would be  seeing her often soon etc.. In negative sentences the particle not  is placed after the first auxiliary e.g. I said I should not  be see - ing him often now. I said he would not be seeing her often now  etc.. In spoken English the contracted form d is used in affirma - tive sentences and the forms shouldnt and wouldnt in negative  sentences.  The Future Continuous -in-the-Past genera lly serves to show  that an action which is future from a definite past moment is ex - pected to take place in the natural course of events. Like the Fu - ture Indefinite -in-the-Past it is also structurally dependent and  is mainly found in object clauses.  e.g. Towards the end of May he had a letter from Rosalind in  which she said that she would soon be announcing her en - gagement to Ralph Udal.  He said he would be seeing her that evening at the Atkinsons.  I felt that in a moment we should be talking soberly  like two  old acquaintances.  It should be noted that the application of the Future Con  tinuous -in-the-Past is infrequent.  3 The Future Perfect -in-the-Past shouldwould have done  denotes an action completed before a definite moment which is fu - ture from  the point of view of the past. But the form hardly ever  occurs in English as it is seldom required by the situation.  e.g. I was afraid that he would have started off by the time I got  to the coast.   52. In addition to the Future -in-the-Past there are oth er means  of expressing future actions from the point of view of the past.  1 The Past Continuous is used to express a future -in-the-past action which is definitely settled. The action is expected to take  place soon after a definite past moment. The time of  its realiza - tion is often though not necessarily indicated in the sentence by  means of adverbial modifiers.  e.g. In the pocket of his dinner -jacket was a letter from Annette.  She was coming back in a fortnight.  The last time I saw him he said he was g oing on the stage.  2 To be to  infinitive which is usually treated as a modal  phrase serves like the Past Continuous to indicate a previous  arrangement but in addition to that meaning it generally implies  obligation resulting from that arrangement.  e.g. Ive still got the letter. I was to post it. But of course later I  forgot.  He was beside himself with excitement because his book was  to be published next month.  To be to  infinitive may also serve to express orders or in - structions mainly in re ported speech.  e.g. I had already impressed upon her that she was not to men - tion my name to him.   There was a special order that no one was to come to the sta - tion to see the battalion off.  When it denotes a future action viewed from the past to be to  infinitive may acquire the meaning of something destined to  happen. This meaning is not found with to be to  infinitive  when it is used with reference to the actual future.  e.g. And then came the offer of the research which was to occupy  so much  of his working life.  At that time I did not know what was to become of me.  3 To be going to  infinitive may have two different meanings  a Premeditated intention which means that the person denot - ed by the subject had been planning for some time to p erform the  action that some preparation for the action had been in progress.  This use of the going -to form is chiefly found in object clauses.  e.g. Finn said he was going to write a letter to his uncle in Ireland.  I told George what I was going to say t o the Committee.  It is noteworthy that the Past tense of the going -to form  may however be structurally independent when it occurs in in - dependent sentences. In this case in addition to premeditated in - tention it denotes that the action was not car ried out i.e. the  person indicated by the subject was prevented from carrying out  his intention.   e.g. He was going to meet you himself only his car was stolen.  Its your birthday Stan. I was going to keep it a secret until  tonight.  b The speakers fee ling that the action was unavoidable that  it was imminent. This use of the going -to form is mainly found  in reported speech.  e.g. If only we knew what was going to happen.  You always thought I was going to die didnt you?  I knew he was going to regret the day he had ever written  that letter.  4 The Past Indefinite may be used in two different cases  which are both structurally dependent  a With reference to a future action viewed from the past in  clauses of time condition and concession in accordance with the  rules of the sequence of tenses  e.g. So when Anna was leaving for France I said to her vaguely  that I would look her up when she returned.  Probably she knew that whatever happened he would not  give her away.  I told him if he didnt hurry up hed get no breakfast.  Note. In clauses other than those of time condition and concession the Fu - ture Indefinite -in-the-Past is used even if these clauses are introduced by the con - junctions when and if. e.g. I asked him if he would stay another week with us. The time would come when they would all be proud of Tony.  b In object clauses after one of the past tenses of to see - to attend to take care or to make sure in the principal clause.  e.g. He knew that Rosalind would see that it did not happen.  Mother took care that I held myself well.   53. To sum it up it should be mentioned that though the use  of the Future Indefinite -in-the-Past in theory is similar to that  of the Future Indefinite its use is actually much wider. The use of  the other means o f expressing future actions viewed from the past  is on the contrary much more restricted than the use of the  same means with reference to the real future.  The Rules of the Sequence of Tenses   54. In certain types of subordinate clauses the tenses are  used relatively i.e. the tense form does not refer the action to the  present past or future but shows whether the action of the subor - dinate clause is simultaneous with the action of the principal  clause precedes it or follows it.  The choice of the tens e form in the subordinate clause depends  ion the tense form used in the principal clause. This structurally  dependent use of tenses in certain types of clauses is known as the rules of the sequence of tenses.   55. The relative use of tenses is mainly obse rved in subordi - nate object clauses.   l After one of the past forms in the principal clause includ - ng the Future -in-the-Past we find past forms in the subordinate  clause.  If the action of the object clause is simultaneous with that of  the principal c lause the Past Indefinite or the Past Continuous is  used in the object clause no matter which past form is found in the  principal clause the Past Indefinite the Past Continuous the Past  Perfect the Past Perfect Continuous or the Future -in-the-Past.  e.g. Nobody knew what he meant.  I thought you were joking.  He had not realized how nervous she was.  He would never know what she was thinking.  If the action of the object clause precedes that of the principal  clause the Past Perfect or the Past Perfect Co ntinuous is used in  the object clause no matter which past form is found in the princi - pal clause.  e.g. The people she met seemed to know where she had been what  she had been doing.  He was finally telling them what he had been concealing.  Soames looked a t her. He had said that she had not changed  now he perceived that she had.  If the action of the object clause follows that of the principal  clause the Future -in-the-Past or one of the other means of ex -  pressing future actions viewed from the past is us ed in the object  clause no matter which past tense -aspect form is found in the  principal clause.  e.g. I had feared that my companion would talk too much but it  was soon plain that there was no such danger.  I explained that I was going up to London.  He tho ught of how wet they were going to get in the rain.  She knew that George would be waiting for her.  2 The rules of the sequence of tenses are also observed in ob - ject clauses if one of the present forms is used in the principal  clause.  If the action of th e object clause is simultaneous with that of  the principal clause we find either the Present Indefinite or the  Present Continuous in it no matter which of the present forms is  used in the principal clause.  e.g. Maurice doesnt know what he is doing.  I kno w just how they feel said Sophia.  I am beginning to think youre a fool.  Youve noticed I daresay that she travels a good deal.  Adeline has been telling me he said that her father is  willing to send her abroad.  If the action of the object clause precedes that of the principal  clause we find the Present Perfect the Past Indefinite the  Present Perfect Continuous or the Past Continuous in it no matter  which of the present forms is used in the principal clause.  e.g. I dont know whether any of you have met her.  I dont see why he did it.  I dont want her to see Ive been crying.  Im beginning to understand why your grandfather left you  his house.  If the action of the object clause follows that of the principal  clause we find one of the future forms or one of the other means  of expressing futurity in it no matter which of the present forms  is used in the principal clause.  e.g. I dont think hell ever forgive me for asking these people to  come here.  I expect shell be ringing up again very shortly.  I dont know how Im going to do it.  Ive just told everyone that Im sending him to school this au - tumn.  Shes hoping I shall be back by Monday week.  They havent even told me who my successor is going to be.  3 The rules of the sequence of tenses are obs erved in object  clauses if one of the future forms or one of the means of express - ing future actions is used in the principal clause.  If the action in the object clause is simultaneous with that of  the principal clause we find the Present Indefinite or th e Present  Continuous in it.  e.g. I am sure we shall find we have quite a lot to say to one another.  Sir Walter will tell you that Im not exaggerating.  If the action in the object clause precedes that of the principal  clause we find the Present Perfect or the Past Indefinite in it.  e.g. Miss Sophia will be glad youve come.  They will ask you when you arrived in New York.  I never liked the idea and Im not going to say I did.  Oh come youre not going to tell me that youve never been  in love since you were  in love with me.  If the action in the object clause follows that of the principal  clause we find one of the future forms or one of the other means  of expressing future actions in it.  e.g. Ill tell you what Ill do.  Well let you know what we are going to  do about it.  You are going to say that this will cost you a thousand pounds.  Note 1. Grammars usually say that the choice of the tense form in the subor - dinate clause is free after a present or a future tense form in the principal clause.  This is not qui te correct as only the above described forms can be used in this case  their choice being as strict and as regular as after a past tense form in the princi - pal clause.  It is true the relative use of tense forms is not so obvious after a present  tense for m in the principal clause since the situation is viewed from the moment of  speaking and at first sight the use of tense forms seems to depend only on the  sense. However if we compare the use of tenses in object clauses after a present  past and future ten se form it becomes evident that their choice always depends on  the tense form of the predicate verb in the principal clause.  Besides after a future tense in the principal clause it is a present tense form  that is used in the object clause to express simu ltaneousness but not a future  tense form which might be logically expected see the examples above. It might  also be expected that a present tense form would denote priority after a future  tense form in the principal clause but actually it is the Present  Perfect or the Past  Indefinite that are used.  Note 2. The rules of the sequence of tenses are observed in all object clauses ir - respective of the conjunction or the conjunctive word by which the clause is intro - duced. The object clause may also be joine d to the principal clause asyndetically  see the examples above.  Note 3. It should be noted that the rules of the sequence of tenses hold good in  object clauses after a formal it used as the subject of the principal clause.  e.g. It pleased me to think tha t he was making progress.  It appears that you know my name.  It was remarkable that she seldom thought of Gerald.  It was announced at the commencement of the congress that  a special mission would leave to investigate the crisis.   56. Object clauses are usu ally subordinated to the predicate  of the principal clause. But they may also be subordinated to  some other parts of the sentence expressed by a verbal and occa - sionally by an adjective. In this case the finite form of the subor - dinate clause also depen ds on the form of the predicate verb in  the principal clause.  e.g. He wanted them to see that he was not hostile.  Winslow was fond of saying that he had a large collection of  pictures.  He finally went home satisfied that he would have no trou - ble. John had left in April perfectly ignorant of what he wanted  to become.   57. The rules of the sequence of tenses in object clauses are  sometimes violated. This occurs in the following cases  1 In present -time contexts after a past form in the principal  clause w hen reference is made to the actual present time a the  actual past time b or the actual future time c. This is found In  dialogues in plays novels stories and also in newspaper and ra - dio reports.  e.g. a I told Lewis that were worried about M yrtle.  I was obliged to tell him that too much depends on our de - cision.  Muriel said shes been ringing you all day Mother.  I wonder if you understood a word of what I have been  saying.  b I think you said you came in a taxi.  All night long I have been dreaming about this break - fast. I thought you said you didnt sleep.  c I came to tell you that Ill  vote against you.  I read the other day that they are going to raise the war  pensions.  Did you know she said that Roy is having Lord and  Lady Bosca stle to lunch?  In the above examples we may speak of the absolute use of fi - nite forms as they actually refer the actions to the present past or  future.  It should be pointed out that though there is a tendency in  present -day English to use the finite fo rms absolutely the well -es- tablished tradition of their relative use is still holding ground.  There are numerous examples of the same kind as those given  above in which the rules of the sequence of tenses are strictly ob - served. Moreover sometimes the formal dependence of the finite  form of the object clause on that of the principal clause appears  even illogical contradicting the actual state of things and yet  the tradition does not give way.  e.g. I came to see how your health was he said to Miss M arple.  You are not angry with me because I quite forgot it was my birthday today.  I hear you are going to be married again I thought you were  tired of that game.  I didnt know I was so strong.  2 After a past form in the principal clause when the speaker  believes that he is dealing with facts statements or opinions which  are true of all times are a kind of general truth. In this case the  Present Indefinite is used in the object clause after a past form in  the principal clause. Examples of this kind are n ot very numerous.  e.g. You made me understand what love really is.  They were so young that they did not know what an advan - tage it is to be in society.  Soames was realizing more and more than ever how essential  reputation is to a solicitor.  3 With certa in modal verbs having only one form e.g. must  should ought and need.  e.g. I wrote that I must see him.  He said he was sure that there must be some mistake.  I didnt think you need worry.  I knew that from now on he should do no more work.  Two people advi sed me recently almost in the same words  that I ought to see a doctor.   58. As has been said the rules of the sequence of tenses are  mainly applied in object clauses. Yet these rules are strictly ob - served in some other cases too  a in subject and pr edicative clauses  e.g. How she managed to do it is not known.  This is not what I expected.  That he has behaved as a coward is a fact.  After all its what weve been hoping all along isnt it?  Why they had voted against him was a mystery.  My first impres sion was that they all behaved very well.  That he would soon ask for help was almost a certainty.  My only fear was that Finn would forget what he was sup - posed to be doing.  b in appositive clauses  e.g. The author expresses the confidence that readers of  the paper  will support the candidate.  She had the sensation that someone hidden among the trees  was watching her as she passed.  c in clauses of purpose in which we mainly find the modal  verbs can and may  e.g. I want to move to London so that I can rea lly begin a new life.  As you go leave the door open so that the light may show  you some of the way down.  The doctor stepped around so that she could see him and  nodded.  He exclaimed loudly and clearly so that all might hear.  d in simple sentences as w ell as in all types of clauses in so - called inner speech a stylistic device which consists in the author  describing the thoughts of his characters as if they were speaking  to themselves  e.g. The house wasnt too bad he reflected to himself. It was  good solidly built though rather ugly. It would be quite  comfortable to live in.  It was quite true thought Lady Seal. Neville had spoken.  surprisingly well that morning as though at last he were  fully alive to his responsibilities. She would ask him to  luncheon. But perhaps he would be busy many people  were busy in those days.  e in simple sentences in which a parenthetic sentence is in - serted the tense form of the simple sentence depends on that of  the parenthetic one  e.g. The house had he admitted  a feeling of solidity and security.  The idea wasnt too bad he reflected to himself.  It was all being done very well Mrs Bantry thought.  59. In all the other clauses i.e. other than object subject  predicative appositive clauses and clauses of purpo se the use of  the finite forms is structurally independent i.e. the finite form is  chosen in accordance with the sense to be conveyed.  Yet in narration in the vast majority of attributive clauses as  well as clauses of time cause result comparison con dition or  concession we find past forms. In fact this seems to be the gener - al rule. But the reason why it is used is not its structural depen - dence on the finite form in the principal clause. Since all the  events in narration refer to the past it is o nly natural that one of  the past forms should be used in these types of clauses.  e-g. I was in the garden one morning with Brenda when a car  drew up to the front door.  But no one knew how the Greeks were holding on because  the supplies were getting scarc e. A tall tired -looking man whom he had not met before came  out and without a word led him into the office.  It was one of the happiest afternoons he had ever spent.  She was as glad to end the conversation as he was.  Harris was so overcome with joy that h e fainted.  But when necessary it is possible to use any tense form re - quired by the situation in such clauses.  e.g. Georgie who is now twenty -six had been an undergraduate  at Cambridge where she had taken a degree of economics.  We were standing in the  part of the market that is devoted to  flowers.  It was many years ago said Miss Marple but nevertheless  human nature was very much the same as it is now.  He was as fond of his father as I am of mine.  I had known Palmer when this story starts for nearly four  years.  I had never seen him before and I had never heard anything  about him at the time though I have heard a good deal since.   60. The rules of the sequence of tenses are also observed in  clauses of the second third etc. grade of subordinati on. Yet the  choice of the finite form does not depend in this case on the finite  form in the principal clause   it is determined by the form of the  verb in the clause to which it is subordinated.  e.g. He hurried her away grumbling to himself  1 that he  had known  2 how it would be.  In the above example clause 1 is subordinated to the principal  clause and the Past Perfect is used to express the priority of the  action to that of the principal clause clause 2 however is subor - dinated to clause 1 and the Future -in-the-Past serves to show an  action following that of clause 1. In the following example the Past Indefinite in clause 1 shows  that the action is simultaneous with that of the principal clause  the Past Perfect in clause 2 expresses the prior ity of the action to  that in clause 1. e.g. I discovered   1 that he thought   2 nothing specially  unusual had happened.  The same rule is illustrated in the following examples  e.g. Awkwardly with kindness he asked me about my studies. He  said that Ann had told him how I was working.  But I was delayed and when I arrived the landlady told me that the girl had said she was not used to being kept wait - ing and had gone.  She was always so sure that at last she had found exactly  what she wanted.  I thought  you said that you were trying to get a job.  I thought I knew why they had come.  VOICE   61. Voice is the form of the verb which serves to show  whether the subject of the sentence is the agent or the object of  the action expressed by the predicate verb. Th ere are two voices  in English   the Active Voice and the Passive Voice.  Note. The terms the Active Voice and the Passive Voice are used with reference  to the form of the verb. Sentences in which the verb is used in the Active or in the  Passive Voice are ca lled active and passive constructions respectively.  The Active Voice   62. The Active Voice shows that the person or thing denoted  by the subject of the sentence is the agent the doer of the action  expressed by the predicate verb that it acts.  e.g. I d eny that said Joan.  We know youve been cheating us.  Why have you done it?  George walked over to the window but did not open it. The formation of the finite forms of the Active Voice and the  use of these forms have already been described in Verbs  7-60. Note. In a vast majority of instances the Active Voice has the meaning de - scribed above. Yet there are cases when owing to the lexical character of the verb  the thing denoted by the subject of the sentence cannot be regarded as the doer of  the acti on. This becomes obvious if we compare the following examples  a The maid who opened the door for  b The door opened and Mrs Knight  me told me that Mr March was  appeared with a tea tray  waiting for me.  She closed the door softly and went  The door closed and there was  straight to the telephone.  silence in the large room.  In the examples under a the subject of the sentence is the doer of the action  but in the sentences under b it becomes the object   the door cannot actually  open or close by itself the  action is performed by someone else. Yet examples of  the second kind are also treated in grammar as the Active Voice since the form of  the verb is active.  The Passive Voice   63. The Passive Voice serves to show that the person or  thing denoted by the sub ject of the sentence is not the agent the  doer of the action expressed by the predicate verb but the object  of this action. The subject of a passive verb does not act but is act - ed upon it undergoes an action.  e.g. She was woken from her sleep by his s inging.  They were received with great frankness and charm.  The child knew that she was being praised.  The news will be announced after dinner.  Note. There are a few cases when owing to the lexical character of the verb  the subject of the sentence cannot be regarded as the object undergoing the action  expressed by the predicate verb. Yet examples of this kind are treated in grammar  as the Passive Voice since the form of the verb is passive.  e.g. All of a sudden I realized that I was lost in the wild open c ountry.  After Jacobs was drowned his farm was sold to MacMartin.   64. The Passive Voice is an analytical form which is built up  by means of the auxiliary verb to be in the required finite form  and the participle of the notional verb on the formation of t he participle see Verbs  5 and Appendix  the Present Indefinite   is am are done  the Past Indefinite   was were done  the Future Indefinite   will shall be done  the Present Perfect   has have been done  the Past Perfect   had been done   the Fu ture Perfect   will shall have been done  the Present Continuous   is am are being done  the Past Continuous   was were being done  The interrogative form is built up by placing the first auxilia - ry verb before the subject of the sentence e.g. When  was it done?  Has the work been done? etc.. The negative form is built up by  placing the particle not after the first auxiliary e.g. The work  was not done yesterday. The work will not be done tomorrow etc..  Note. The Passive Voice may also be formed  by means of the auxiliary verb to  get and the participle of the notional verb. But instances of this kind are infre - quent even in informal English and restricted mainly to situations and contexts  dealing with accidental or unpleasant happenings.  e.g. The boy got hurt on his way home.  The table was turned over sideways and the china lamp got broken.  Somebody pushed Janes elbow and her drink got spilt.  Dont make such a noise. Youll get turned out.  Types of Passive Constructions   65. English is rich in  various types of passive constructions  1 The subject of the passive construction may correspond to  the direct object of the verb. This type of passive construction may  be called the Direct Passive.  e.g. At twilight he was carried to the field hospital.  Then he noticed that the window in a room opposite was being  opened he could not see by whom.  Nearly all the furniture will be taken out of the room.  Note. There are a number of verbs in English which can be used in the Passive  Voice while with their equi valents in Russian the passive construction is impossi - ble. To these verbs belong for example to approach to attend to answer to kelp  to assist to follow to influence to join to watch and some others.  e-g. Lady Bor was assisted to her car just b efore tea.  The general was followed into the room by his younger daughter.  At that moment they were joined by the others.  It should be noted that the Direct Passive is part of two wide - ly used constructions  a It forms the basis of the construction which  may be called  the complex subject see Notes on the Syntactic Structure of the Sentence p. 426.  e.g. She is said to be a first -class teacher.  The children as usual were busy doing all the things they  had been told not to do.  I was not allowed to ch at. He was appointed secretary of the committee.  He was seen talking to the Minister.  b The construction with a formal it as subject may also con - tain the passive of verbs denoting mental and physical perceptions  suggestion order request and decision as well as of verbs of say - ing such as to agree to announce to arrange to believe to de  cide to demand to determine to expect to explain to feel to  know to notice to observe to propose to recommend to report to  require to request to rum our to say to suggest to think to  understand and the like. This passive construction is followed by a  clause introduced as a rule by the conjunction that  e.g. It was explained that Roy was unaccountably absent from  duty that morning.  It was known th at he would not tolerate any criticism.  It was arranged that Martin should have the room all to  himself.  It is said that she turned the job down.  Although the Direct Passive is the most commonly used passive  construction there are certain restrictions to its application  a The restrictions may be due to the nature of the direct ob - ject. The passive construction is impossible when the direct object  of the verb is expressed by an infinitive e.g. We arranged to meet  at 5 oclock. a clause e.g.  saw tha t he knew about it. a reflex - ive pronoun or a noun with a possessive pronoun referring to the  same person as the subject of the sentence e.g. He hurt himself - He cut his finger..  b Sometimes there is no passive construction because the verb  and the d irect object are so closely connected that they form a set  phrase and cannot be separated e.g. to keep ones word to lose  courage to lose heart to lose ones patience to take alarm to  take courage to take flight and many others.  Certain phrases of th is kind however admit of a passive con - struction e.g. to take care to take no notice to pay attention to  take responsibility and some others.  e.g. He paused at each table and then when no notice was taken  of him with a smile he passed on.  In his school a great deal of attention is paid to mathematics.  c In addition to intransitive verbs which are not used in the  passive some transitive verbs at least in certain uses do not oc - cur in the passive either.  e.g. The boy resembled his father.  The h at suits becomes you.  The coat does not fit you.  He has possesses a sharp sense of humour.  He lacks confidence.  The place holds 500 people.  Yet in spite of the above restrictions the use of the Direct  Passive is quite extensive in English.  2 There ar e a number of verbs in English which take two ob - jects   a direct and indirect. The most frequently used verbs of  this kind are to give to grant to leave to lend to offer to pay to  promise to send to show to tell and a few others.  These verbs may  have two passive constructions  a The Direct Passive which has been described above.  e.g. When I came to the office a telegram was given to me.  Although a very good job was offered to me I had to turn it  down.  As a rule the indirect object takes the p reposition to after the  verb in the Passive.  b The indirect object of the verb may also become the subject  of the passive construction. This type of passive construction may  be called the Indirect Passive.  e.g. I was told some very interesting news.  He to ld me that he had been offered a well -paid job at a pub - lishing house.  In this passive construction the verb is always followed by the  direct object news a job it is called a retained object since it is  retained by the verb.  Although the Indirect Pass ive is a construction peculiar to En - glish its use is not very common. It is freely used only with the  verb to tell. In this case the direct object is mainly expressed by a  clause a and occasionally by a noun or pronoun b. e.g. a Im told that his new house will be finished soon.  I didnt care if Croxton was told I didnt like him.  b I am told things. I appear to take them in   but they just  pass through my brain and are gone.  You werent told anything because there isnt anything to  tell you.  The Indirect Passive is also found with set phrases containing  the verb to give occasionally to grant followed by a noun e.g. to give a chance to give a choice to give a job to give an explanation  to give an opportunity to give a party to give a post  to give a sen - tence to give a task to give First Aid to give news to give notice  to give orders to give prominence to give shelter to grant an audi  ence to grant leave and the like.  e.g. I havent been given a chance to explain.  He was given an opportunity to go to Columbia to attend the  Winter Meeting of the Physical Society.  He disliked me when I had been given my job there.  He was given a life sentence.  On Johns tenth birthday he was given a party.  Hed been granted leave of absence from his work to make re- searches at the university library.  But in free combinations the verb to give and the other verb  mentioned above are infrequent in the Indirect Passive.  e.g. To deal with two square inches of mutton you were given a  knife and fork big eno ugh for a roasted ox.  In the hotel Charles was shown his room.  She had been left an immense fortune.  Never mind what I was promised or not promised he snarled.  The moment you are offered something that you want   you want something else.  Note. There are  a number of verbs in English which require a direct and an in  direct object in the active construction but they admit only of one passive n struction namely the Direct Passive. Among them we find to bring to play to read to telegraph to write and some others.  e.g. I wrote him a letter.  A letter was written to him.  I played him the tune.  The tune was played to him.  He telegraphed me the news. ? The news was telegraphed to me.  3 There are a great number of verbs in English that require a  prepositional object. These verbs may also be used in the passive  the subject of the passive construction corresponds then to the  prepositional object. The preposition retains its place after the  verb. This construction may be called the Prepositional Pass ive. e.g. He was highly thought of in his village.  When they found her lying on the floor the doctor was sent  for. The Prepositional Passive is found in English more often than  the Indirect Passive. Yet the use of this construction is not very  extensive e ither. Its application is restricted in two ways  a Though in principle it may be formed from any verb which  takes a prepositional object it is regularly found with only a lim - ited number of verbs. The most commonly occurring of them are  1 verbs of s peaking such as to comment on to speak about  of to to talk about of to write about  e.g. You have been a good deal talked about.  She did all the rough work which Mrs Rodd told her to do  spoke when she was spoken to but not otherwise and ate a  very great deal of food at lunch.  His book was commented on by the newspapers.  2 the verb to look in different meanings with various prepo - sitions such as to look at to upon after for into  e.g. She could feel she was being looked at and it pleased  her. The suit -cases were looked after.  He was looked upon as their leader.  3 verbs expressing mockery or blame such as to frown at to  laugh at to mock at to shout at to sneer at to spit at to swear  at to whistle at  e.g. She had an uncomfortable  feeling that she was being laughed at.  Julia had turned her head away hurriedly and had been  frowned at by her mother.  4 also a miscellaneous group of verbs including to account  for to approve of to ask for to call for to deal with to depend  on t o disapprove of to dispose of to rely on to send for to think  of and a few others  e.g. No one could understand a word he said and an interpreter  was sent for.  Her request was disapproved of.  At the college he was thought of as being a big man.  5 Occasionally other verbs including set phrases such as to get in touch with to make a fool of to take care of etc. are  found in the Prepositional Passive construction but their occur - rence seems to be infrequent  e.g. Its all taken care of.  Youre be ing made a fool of thats all.  b The Prepositional Passive is not used with verbs which take  two objects direct and prepositional. Here belong such verbs as to announce to dedicate to devote to explain something to some  body to point out to propo se to say to suggest etc. They can  only have a Direct Passive construction.  e.g. The difficulty was then explained to her.  Soon the engagement was announced to the family.  The mistake was pointed out to him.  A new plan was suggested to us.  The direct ob ject after some of these verbs is rather often ex  pressed by a clause. In this case the only possible passive con - struction is the one with a formal it as subject.  e.g. It had been explained to Sylvia that Renny had gone  It was announced to them that the  accommodation problem  was now settled.  4 There is another passive construction possible in English  the subject of the passive construction corresponds to an adverbi - al modifier of place in the active construction. In this case the  preposition also reta ins its place after the verb.  e.g. The occupant of the apartment was fully clothed although  the bed had been slept in.  The room looked as if it had not been lived in for years.  The high -backed ugly chairs looked as if they had once been  sat in by cardina ls. The use of this construction is rare and usually occurs with  the verbs mentioned in the examples.  The Use of Finite Forms in the Passive Voice   66. The use of finite forms in the Passive Voice is not exact - ly parallel to those of the Active Voice. Th is can be accounted for  by two reasons 1 the absence of certain finite forms in the pas - sive and 2 the lexical character of the verb namely the differen - tiation between terminative and durative verbs.  1 The Passive Voice lacks the Future Continuous th e Future  Continuous -in-the-Past and all the Perfect Continuous forms.  2 The lexical character of the verb affects the meaning of all  the Indefinite Passive tenses.  With durative verbs the use of the Indefinite Passive tenses is  parallel to the corresponding active forms.  e.g. The plural of nouns is formed with the help of the suffix -s. He was an ardent fighter for freedom and independence. He  was loved by millions and hated only by a handful.  His place in history is secure. He will be remembered long af - ter his enemies have been forgotten.  She telephoned to know where the meeting would be held.  But with terminative verbs the grammatical meaning of the  Indefinite passive forms is wider than that of the corresponding  active forms. They may denote either an act ion or a state result - ing from a previously accomplished action a resultant state.  Cf Action  State  At the time the houses in Oak  The house was very solidly  Crescent were built it wasnt  built.  considered that the working  classes needed baths.  Everyth ing was settled twenty        So thats all settled.  minutes after I arrived there.  Im not often shocked you  Indeed? I am shocked to hear it.  know but this does shock  me a little.  Note. Certain combinations of the verb to be with a participle are to be  treated  as nominal predicates as they are devoid of the idea of action see also Verbs  179 245.  e.g. He is quite convinced that it is true.  I am prepared to believe you.  I dont know anything. They are so reserved about it.  Of course Im disappoin ted you cant come.  The Indefinite passive forms denote an action in the following  cases  a if the action expressed by the passive form is part of a suc - cession of actions  e.g. The door opened and the doctor was shown in.  Brenda and Lawrence came to tri al but no case was brought  against them and they were dismissed.  b if the passive form denotes a recurrent action.  In this case there are indications of frequency in the sentence.  They may be expressed in various ways mainly by adverbs of fre - quency or  by the use of nouns in the plural.  e.g. She read Byron to him and was often puzzled by the strange  interpretations he gave to some passages.  He is invited to all the best dances.  c if the time of the action expressed by the passive form is  indicated in the sentence by adverbial modifiers of time including  clauses  e.g. The novel was written during the summer of 1918.  The whole affair was soon forgotten.  d if the manner in which the action is performed occasionally  the purpose of the action is indica ted by means of an adverbial  modifier  e.g. Nothing thats worth doing is done easily.  Tea was finished in silence.  The front door was slowly closed.  I was sent into the hospital to be X -rayed.  e if the doer of the action is indicated in the sentence in  such  cases the doer often happens to be a non -personal agent and the  passive form without it would be understood as expressing a state  e.g. Soames was both annoyed and surprised by my glance.  He was disturbed by a series of explosions.  Note. Yet someti mes we find sentences in which the passive form denotes a  state even when the doer is indicated.  e.g. She looked into the bedroom the bed was made as though by the hand of a man.  The two houses were connected by a gallery.  If none of the above mentioned indications are found in the  sentence or in a wider context the Indefinite passive forms gener - ally express with terminative verbs a state resulting from a pre - viously accomplished action.  e.g. Were defeated. Lets go back to New York and start all o ver again.  A table is set out for luncheon in the garden.  The door was locked there was nobody in sight.  The big bed was covered with a quilt.  Her car a green Fiat was parked outside.  If you come so late the front door will be locked and youll  have to go by the back door.  Note The Future Indefinite Passive tends on the whole to denote an action  not a state even if there are no special indications such as those described above.  e.g. You neednt worry. Every precaution will be taken.  What do I need to take with me? Nothing. Everything you need will be  provided for you  67. The use of the Present and Past Continuous Passive is  parallel to the use of the corresponding active forms.  e-g. What sort of research is being done and who is doing it?  He lo st his temper and said he was always being made to do  everything he didnt want to.  The use of the Perfect passive forms is also parallel to the cor - responding active forms.  e.g. You can see that this glass has been used.  Why did you come? Ive been t urned out of the place  where I live.  Ever since I came into this silly house I have been made to  look like a fool.  Nancy looked displeased and told me she had been sent to  fetch the breakfast tray.  All of a sudden he realized the full force of what he had  been  told.  I suspected that I had been followed and watched since I ar - rived in London.  Note 1. As has been mentioned before the Future Perfect is not of frequent  occurrence in the active. In the passive its use is quite uncommon.  Note 2. The sentences The work is finished and The work has been finished are somewhat similar in meaning. Yet there is a difference between them the former  serves to express a state in the present which is the result of the previously accom - plished action the latter denotes  the action proper which is accomplished by the  present moment.  The Choice of the Passive Construction   68. The passive is not the reverse of the active. The two con - structions are not parallel in their use and serve different purposes.  As a general rule  the passive construction is used when there  is no need to mention the agent of the action because it is either  easily understood from the situation or context a or because it is  self-evident b or because it happens to be any number of uni - dentifie d people c.  e.g. a Roger was invited to dinner at their house every Sunday  by the people living in the house.  The ambulance arrived and she was taken to hospital by the ambulance.  b Her two brothers were killed in the war.  The telegram had been delive red in time.  He was arrested in a hotel.  c In my young days it was considered bad manners to take  medicines with ones meals. It was on a par with blow  ing your nose at the dinner table.  It just wasnt done. In industry coal is now used much  less than befor e. Occasionally the passive is used when the agent of the action  is not known or kept secret for some reason.  e.g. All my books were totally disarranged in ray absence and now  I cant find the book I want.  At night his car was broken into and a few things were stolen  from it.  I was told that you were getting a divorce from your husband.  As there is no need to mention the agent of the action in the  above cases the Passive Voice makes it possible to shift the focus  of attention onto other parts of the senten ce. Although there is usually no mention of the agent of the ac - tion in passive constructions it sometimes becomes necessary to  indicate the doer and then a by -phrase is used.  e.g. Other possibilities were talked of by some of my colleagues.  In this case  a corresponding active construction is possible  e.g. Some of my colleagues talked of other possibilities.  However there appears to be a difference between the two sen - tences which lies in the fact that in the active construction it is the  words other p ossibilities that are made the centre of communication  and in the passive construction the focus is shifted to some of my  colleagues. End position is generally connected with a stronger  stress and thus a word is made more prominent in this case. The  passive may be called a word -order device here. As logical stress is  laid on two different parts of the sentence in the active and in the  passive the two constructions cannot be regarded as interchange - able. As has been earlier said they serve different pu rposes.  The following examples illustrate the use of passive construc - tions in which stress is laid on the doer of the action  e-g- You cant go wrong if you are advised by me. Auntie Alice is  always right.  His pleasant colour was heightened by exercise.  But has your boys conduct ever been influenced by your rea - sons?  With certain verbs the passive is impossible without the men - tion of the agent as the sentence would be meaningless without it.  This is the case with such verbs as to accent to accompany  to at  tend to attract to bring about to characterize to cause to con  front to control to enhance to follow to govern to join to influ  ence to mark to overtake to rule to seize to set off to visit and  some others.  e.g. The answer was followed by an impressive silence.  He was accompanied by his father who was very nervous.  He is very easily influenced by the ideas of anyone whom he  meets.  Then my attention was caught by the noise coming from be - hind the fence.  Reasons for the Frequent Occu rrence of the Passive   69. It is common knowledge that the passive is extensively  used in English. This seems to be due to a number of reasons  1 In English there are no means of avoiding the indication of  the doer of the action in active constructions.  In other languages we find special active constructions which  make it possible to avoid any mention of the agent. For example  in Russian there are several grammatical means that serve the  purpose  a the so -called indefinite -personal sentences in which th ere is  no subject and the predicate is in the third person plural  e.g.                   .  b sentences with reflexive verbs  e.g.        .         .       .  c impersonal sentences  e.g. He      .       . In French and German the same idea is often exp ressed in sen - tences with the indefinite pronoun on Fr. and man Ger..  e.g. He is much spoken about  He is said to be ill.  in the town.  Man spricht viel von ihm  Man sagt dass er krank ist.  in der Stadt.  On parle beacoup de lui dans       On dit quil e st malade.  la ville.  It is true that in English the indefinite pronoun one and occa - sionally the personal pronouns we you and they and the noun peo- ple may be used in the same way.  e.g. One ought to keep ones languages up said Roy his gaze  was sole mn reproving understanding. Its terrible how  one forgets them. Isnt it?  One will have to think twice about accepting invitations   if there is a risk of being made miserable. One will just have  to refuse.  Is that the old lady who lives in the house by the church?  Thats right. They say shes sharp said Tiddler.  They say theres nothing goes on near that Miss Marple  doesnt hear about.  In my young days it was considered to be bad manners to  take medicines with ones meals. If you had to take p ills or capsules or a spoonful of something you went out of  the room to do so.  Oh Im sure I never said anything of the kind Lola laughed.  People exaggerate so.  But for some reason or other the use of this kind of sentences  is restricted and Engl ish instead resorts to passive constructions.  2 In English owing to the loss of distinction between the ac - cusative and the dative cases the number of verbs taking a direct  object is quite considerable. It accounts for the extensive use of  the Direct Pa ssive.  3 There is a great variety of passive constructions in English.  Although some of them are restricted in their application they  still contribute to the frequent occurrence of the Passive.  MOOD   70. Generally Mood shows the relation between the actio n ex- pressed by the predicate verb and reality. This relation is estab - lished by the speaker.  In present -day English the category of mood is made up by a  set of forms opposed to each other in presenting the event de - scribed as a real fact a problematic  action or as something un - real that does not exist.   71. Actions represented as real facts are expressed by the In - dicative Mood.  e.g. Architects have done some very good work too in designing  new schools. Many of these are prefabricated which means  that as much of the building work as possible is done not on the building site but in factories where mass produc - tion methods are used.  When the brothers had gone home Mr Waterall announced  that they were a much pleasanter pair of young men than  he had  been led to believe.  The Indicative Mood is characterized by a great number of  tense -aspect -phase forms which may be used in the Active or in the  Passive Voice. These forms have been described in Verbs  7-68. Note. It should be stressed that the use o f the Indicative Mood does not always -. mean that the action expressed by the predicate verb is true to fact that it actually  takes or took or will take place in reality. When the speaker uses the Indicative  Mood he merely represents an action as a fac t but he may be mistaken or even tell - ing a lie.  e.g. Ive seen to it he said but everyone knew it was not true.   72. Commands and requests which are problematic actions  are expressed by the Imperative Mood.  The Imperative Mood is the plain stem of the verb e.g. Come  over here. Listen to him etc.. It may be used in the affirmative  and in the negative form. The negative form is an analytical form  built up by means of the plain stem of the auxiliary verb to do fol- lowed by not in spoken English   dont and the infinitive of the  notional verb without to e.g. Dont go over there. Dont listen to  him etc.. The negative form of the verb to be is also built up by  means of the auxiliary verb to do e.g. Dont be inquisitive. Dont  be a fool etc..  If we wish to make a command or request more expressive we use the emphatic form. It is also an analytical form built up with  the help of the plain stem of the auxiliary verb to do which is  placed before the notional verb including to be e.g. Do come ov er here. Do listen to him. Do be quiet etc..  A command or request is generally addressed to the second  person singular or plural see the examples above. There is usual - ly no need to mention the subject of the action before the verb in  the Imperative M ood. But occasionally the verb may be preceded  by you in familiar style e.g. You dont worry..  A command or request may be addressed to the third person  singular or plural. Commands and requests of this kind are formed  with the help of the plain stem of  the verb to let which is followed  by a personal pronoun in the objective case him her it or them  and the infinitive of the notional verb without to e.g. Let him go  there at once. Let them do it by themselves etc..  A command or request may be addres sed to the first person  plural. It is also formed with the help of the plain stem of the verb  to let followed by the pronoun us the contracted form is lets  and the infinitive of the notional verb. This form is actually an  invitation to a joint action e .g. Lets have a cup of tea. Lets do  it together etc.. In the negative form lets is followed by not e.g. Lets not talk about it..  Note. In colloquial English we also find Dont lets talk about it.   73. Actions represented as unreal are in present -day English  expressed by a variety of forms.  Among them there is a mood form   the Conditional Mood  see  124.  The fact that there are a number of forms engaged in ex - pressing unreal actions can be explained historically.  In the older periods English us ed to be a synthetic language  and had special forms which served to express unreal actions  the so -called Subjunctive Mood. It was built up synthetically by  means of inflections. As a result of loss of inflections the differ - ence between the forms of th e Indicative Mood and the Subjunctive  Mood has in most cases disappeared. The place of the old Subjunc - tive Mood was in a number of cases taken up by analytical forms  and modal phrases i.e. combinations of modal verbs with the in - finitive. It is this h istorical process that accounts for the great  variety of different forms expressing unreality in modern En - glish.  As some of the forms expressing problematic or unreal actions  are modal phrases it is necessary before describing the different  forms of unr eality to treat modal verbs first.   74. The speakers attitude towards the action in the sentence  may be expressed in different ways  1 By one of the mood forms which serve as has been said to  show whether the action is represented as a real fact or as pr ob- lematic or unreal. This form of expression is found in every sen  tence because it is indispensable to predication.  2 By modal verbs which represent an action as necessary or  unnecessary possible or impossible certain or doubtful and the  like. But moda l verbs need not be used in every sentence and are  therefore to be regarded as an additional means of expressing the  speakers attitude towards the action in the sentence.  3 By attitudinal adverbs such as certainly perhaps probably  luckily unfortuna tely etc. see also Adverbs  2 8. They ex - press different degrees of certainty on the part of the speaker or  the desirability of the action from his point of view.  Modal Verbs  75. We find the following modal verbs in English can may.  must ought  shall should will need and dare. Besides to have  and to be in some of their uses are also classed among modal  verbs.  A modal verb in combination with the infinitive forms a modal  compound predicate.  Modal verbs are defective verbs since they lack man y forms  characteristic of regular verbs they have no -s in the third per - son singular in the present tense and no verbals so they have no  analytical forms some of them lack the form of the past tense.  Modal verbs have the following peculiarities  1 they  are followed by the infinitive without the particle to with the exception of ought to have and to be  2 their interrogative and negative forms are built up without  the auxiliary do. Most of the modal verbs have more than one meaning. Each of  their meanin gs is characterized by a specific usage.  1 Some of the meanings may be found in all kinds of sentenc - es others occur only in affirmative or interrogative or negative  sentences  2 Different meanings may be associated with different forms  of the infinitive   simple and perfect both in the active and pas - sive forms continuous and perfect continuous  3 If the modal verbs have more than one form can  could - may  might will   would also the verbs to have and to be  their different meanings are not necessa rily found in all those  forms.  The use of modal verbs is in most cases independent of the  structure of the sentence the use of this or that modal verb is de - termined by the attitude of the speaker towards the facts con - tained in the sentence. In this ca se we may speak of the free or in - dependent use of modal verbs.  e.g. He admires you. He thinks youre a little beauty. Perhaps I oughtnt to have told you that.  He may be in the hall now waiting for me.  But sometimes the use of certain modal verbs depend s on the  structure of the sentence mainly on the type of the subordinate  clause and occasionally also on the lexical character of the predi - cate verb in the principal clause. This may be called the structural - ly dependent use of modal verbs.  e.g. It is obviously necessary that an investigation should be  made.  Christine feared she might not be met at all.  As the difference between the active and the passive forms of the infinitive is of  no consequence for the meaning of the modal verb there is no need t o illustrate these  forms separately. However instances where the differentiation between the active  and the passive infinitive is important are dealt with specialty.  When the use of modal verbs is structurally dependent their  meaning is sometimes weake ned in fact it may be quite vague.  This may be accounted for by the fact that these verbs become  rather part of the structure than bearers of individual meaning.  It is important to take into account one more feature peculiar  to modal verbs. They all show  that a certain action is represented  as necessary possible desirable doubtful etc. from the point of view of the speaker. Consequently modal verbs are generally used  in conversation In past -time contexts they may be found only in  reported speech or thought. Thus You should have done it before  or He might be wrong or It must be true cannot be possibly found  in narration unless they are used after He thought that... . He said that... . He knew that... etc. The only exceptions are the past tense form s could would  had was and might which may be used not only in conversation  but also in narration.  e.g. Walker was illiterate and could not sign his name.  When I looked at her I saw tears in her eyes. So I had to tell her the truth.  can  76. The modal v erb can has the following forms can  the present tense e.g. He can speak English and could   the past tense. The form could is used in two ways a in past -time contexts  as a form of the Indicative Mood e.g. He could speak English  when he was a child  b in present -time contexts to express unre  ality or as a milder and more polite form of can or as a form  implying more uncertainty than can e.g. He could speak English  if necessary. Could I help you? Could it be true? Compare with  the Russian                   unreality. He     ? politeness  He      ! uncertainty.   77. Can has the following meanings  1 ability capability  e.g. I can imagine how angry he is.  He can re ad a little French.  This meaning may also be expressed by to be able. The phrase  can be used in all tense -forms if necessary.  In the meaning of ability and capability can occurs in all kinds  of sentences.  e.g. She can play a few simple tunes on the piano.  Can you write with your left hand?  I cannot cant promise you anything.  In this case can is followed by the simple infinitive see the ex - amples above and reference is made to the present. But depending  on the context it may also refer to the future.  e.g. We can discuss your paper after lunch.  However if the time reference is not clear from the context or  if it is necessary to stress that the action refers to the future  shallwill be able is used.  e.g. He will be able to write to us from Portugal.  I shall be able to earn my own living soon.  The form could may be used in past -time contexts and in this  case it is followed by a simple infinitive. It is a form of the Indica - tive Mood here.  e.g. He could read a great deal during the holidays.  Could the bo y read before he went to school?  After what had happened I couldnt trust him.  The form could may also be used in present -time contexts in  combination with the simple infinitive to express unreality with  reference to the present or future.  e.g. I dont wa nt my daughter to be a typist. Why not? She could  be secretary to some interesting man.      You could articulate more distinctly with that cigarette out  of your mouth         As the form could may be used in two ways see  76 it is Usually understood as expressing unreality with reference to the  present  or future unless there are indications of past time in the  sentence or in the context. Thus the sentence She could paint  landscapes will be understood as        . If there is no indication of past time in the context but the speak  er wishes to refer the action to the past waswere able is used in- stead of could to avoid ambiguity.  e.g. She was able to explain the mystery.  In combination with the perfect infinitive could indicates that  the action was not carried out in the past.  e.g. She could have explained the mystery.     -        2 possibility due to circumstances  e.g. You can see the forest through the other window.  We can use either the Present Perfect or the Present Perfect  Continuous in this sentence.  In this meaning can is found in all kinds of sentences. It is fol - lowed by the simple infinitive and it refers the action to the  present or future.  e.g. You can obtain a dog from the Dogs Home at Battersea.  Can we use the indefinite article with this noun?  We cant use the i ndefinite article with this noun.  In past -time contexts the form could is used. It is followed by  the simple infinitive in this case.  e.g. You could see the forest through the other window before the  new block of houses was erected.  The form could in combi nation with the simple infinitive may  also express unreality with reference to the present or future.  e.g. You could see the house from here if it were not so dark.  In combination with the perfect infinitive could indicates that  the action was not carried  out in the past.  e.g. You could have seen the house from there if it had not been  so dark.  Note. When could is used with reference to the past it denotes only the ability  or possibility of performing an action but not the realization of the action. There  fore when a realized or an unrealized action is expressed  could is naturally not  used. If an action was carried out in the past it is expressed with the help of to manage or to succeed the latter is used in literary style.  e.g. He managed to settle t he difficulty.  He succeeded in attaining his aim.  If an action was not realized in the past it is expressed with the help of to fail  or to manage and to succeed in the negative form.  e.g. He failed to reach the peak.  He did not manage to settle the diffic ulty. Compare with the Russian           - .  In his youth he could swim across the Volga.  But            .   managed to swim  across the Volga last year. Also in                .   failed didnt manage to swim across the Volga last year.  As for to be able it may depending on the lexical character of the infinitive  or the context express either the ability or possibility of performing an ac tion or  the realization of that action.  e.g. He was able to speak English well.      - - .  was able to get the book from the library.       - .  3 permission  e.g. You can take my umbrella . Can in this meaning is found in affirmative sentences inter - rogative sentences in which a request is expressed and in negative  sentences where it expresses prohibition.  Cf. You can use my car.  Can I use your car?  You cant use my car today.  In this me aning can is combined with the simple infinitive.  The form could with reference to the present is found only in  interrogative sentences in which it expresses a more polite request.  e.g. Could I use your car?  The form could is found in reported speech i.e.  in accordance  with the rules of the sequence of tenses.  e.g. He said that I could use his car.  He asked me if he could use my car.  4 uncertainty doubt  e.g. Can it be true?  In this meaning can is found only in interrogative sentences  in general quest ions. Besides sentences of this kind are often  emotionally coloured and so their application is rather restricted.  Depending on the time reference can in this meaning is used  in combination with different forms of the infinitive.  Thus if reference is m ade to the present the simple infinitive  is found with stative verbs.  e.g. Can he really be ill? Can it be so late?  With dynamic verbs the continuous infinitive is used.  e.g. Can she be telling lies?  Can he be making the investigation all alone?  Can in combination with the perfect infinitive refers the ac - tion to the past.  e.g. Can he have said it? Can she have told a lie?  The combination of can with the perfect infinitive may also  indicate an action begun in the past and continued into the mo - ment of s peaking. This is usually found with stative verbs.  e.g. Can she really have been at home all this time?  However if can is followed by a dynamic verb the Perfect  Continuous infinitive is used.  e.g. Can she have been waiting for us so long?  Could with refer ence to the present is also used in this way  implying more uncertainty.  e.g. Could it be true?  Could she be telling lies?  Could he have said it? Could she have been waiting for us so long?  In Russian both variants with can and could are rendered in  the same way     ?     ? and so on.  5 improbability  e.g. It cant be true.     .     . In this meaning can is found only in negative sentences which  are often emotionally coloured. Depending on the time reference  this can is also used with different forms of the infinitive.  e.g. He cant be really ill.  She cant be telling lies. He cant have said it. She cant have been at home all this time.  She cant have been waiting for us so long.  Could is also used in this way making the statement less cate - gorical.  e.g. It couldnt be true.  She couldnt be telling lies.  He couldnt have said it. She couldnt have been at home all this time.  She couldnt have been waiting for us so long.   78. Can and could followed by different forms of the infinitive  are found in special questions where they are used for emotional co - louring for instance to express puzzlement impatience etc..  e.g. What can could he mean?  What can could he be doing?  What can c ould he have done?  Where can could he have gone to?  It can be rendered in Russian as         ?  79. As is seen from the above examples the form could refer - ring to the present is sometimes clearly opposed to can in that it  expresses unreality whereas can expresses reality. This may be ob - served in the following meanings  ability   He can speak English.  He could speak English if necessary.  possibility due to circumstances   You can get the book from the library.  You could get the book from the library if necessary.  In the other meanings however this difference between the  two forms is obliterated. Could is used either as a milder or more  polite form of can a or as a form implying more uncertainty  than can b a permission   Can I use your pen?  Could I use your pen? more polite  b uncertainty doubt improb ability   Can it be true?  Could it be true? less certain  It cant be true.  It couldnt be true less certain   80 - In addition to the above cases illustrating the inde - pendent use of can this modal verb occurs in adverbial clauses of  purpose where i t is structurally dependent for a detailed treat - ment of this use of can see Verbs  143.  e.g. Ill leave the newspaper on the table so that he can see it at once.  I left the newspaper on the table so that he could see it at once.   81. Note the foll owing set phrases with can  a She cant help crying.  He couldn t help laughing .  cant help doing  means     ... or       -.  b I cant but ask him about it.  They couldnt but refuse him.   cant but do something  means         ... . c  cant possibly do it. I couldnt possibly refuse him.  I cant couldnt possibly do means         ... . may   82. The modal verb may has the following forms may  the present tens e e.g. It may be true and might   the Past tense.  The form might is used in two ways a in past -time contexts  mainly in reported speech in accordance with the rules of the se - quence of tenses e.g. He told me that it might be true and b in  present -time contexts as a milder and more polite form of may or as a form implying more uncertainty than may e.g. Might I come  and see you? It might be true or to express unreality e.g. He might have fallen ill if he hadnt taken the pills.   83. May has the  following meanings  1 supposition implying uncertainty  e.g. He may be busy getting ready for his trip.  In Russian this meaning is generally rendered by means of the  modal adverbs   and    . In English this meaning may also be rendered by m eans of the  attitudinal adverbs perhaps and maybe.  In the meaning of supposition implying uncertainty the verb  may occurs in affirmative and negative sentences.  e.g. He may be at home.  He may not be at home.     .  -      .  In this meaning may can be followed by different forms of the  infinitive depending on the time reference expressed.  May in combination with the simple infinitive usually refers  the action to the future.  e.g. He may come soon.  The action may also refer to the present but only with stative  verbs.  e.g. He may be ill. He may not know about it.  May in combination with the Continuous infinitive of dynamic  Verbs refers the action to the present.  e.g. Its too late to phone him now. He may be sleeping.  I never see him about now. For all I know he may be writing  a book.  May in combination with the Perfect infinitive refers the ac - tion to the past.  e.g. He may have fallen ill.  Whats happened to the dog? I said. It isnt here. His  master may have taken  it with him.  The combination of may with the Perfect infinitive may also  indicate an action begun in the past and continued into the mo - ment of speaking. This is usually found with stative verbs.  e.g. He may have been at home for about two hours.  Howeve r if may is followed by a dynamic verb the Perfect  Continuous infinitive is used.  e.g. He may have been waiting for us for an hour.  In the meaning of supposition implying uncertainty the form  might is also found. It differs from the form may in that it em- phasizes the idea of uncertainty. It may be followed by the sim - ple Continuous or Perfect infinitive.  e.g. He might come soon.  He might be ill.  He might be doing his lessons now.  He might have spoken to her yesterday.  2 possibility due to circumstan ces e.g. You may order a taxi by telephone.  A useful rough -and-ready rule is that time adverbs may come  at either end of the sentence but not in the middle.  May in this meaning occurs only in affirmative sentences and  is followed only by the simple infin itive.  The form might is used in past -time contexts in accordance  with the rules of the sequence of tenses.  e.g. He said he might order a taxi by telephone.  Might followed by the Perfect infinitive indicates that the ac - tion was not carried out owing to certain circumstances ex - pressed in the sentence or implied.  e.g. He might have fallen ill if he hadnt taken the medicine.  Luckily he wasnt driving the car. He might have been hurt.  You are so careless. You might have broken the cup.          . 3 permission  e.g. The director is alone now. So you may see him now.  May in this meaning is found in affirmative sentences in in - terrogative sentences which usually express a request and in nega - tive sentences where it denotes prohibition. But in negative sen - tences it is not common as prohibition is generally expressed by  other modal verbs see can and must.  e.g. You may smoke in here.  May I smoke in here?  You may not smoke in here.  In this meaning may is combined onl y with the simple infinitive.  In interrogative sentences the form might is also found when  we wish to express a more polite request.  e.g. Might I join you?  In reported speech the form might is used.  e.g. He told me that I might smoke in the room.  He asked me if he might join us.  4 disapproval or reproach  e.g. You might carry the parcel for me.  You might have helped me.  Here we find only the form might used in affirmative sentenc - es and followed by the simple or Perfect infinitive. In the latter  case it e xpresses reproach for the non -performance of an action.   84. The form might which expresses unreality is not always  Parallel to may.  Might expresses unreality only in combination with the Per - fect infinitive.  e.g. You might have let me know about it bef orehand.  There was a car accident in front of our house. Luckily  Tommy was at school. He might have been killed.  In most cases might is used as a milder and more polite form than  may a or as a form implying a greater degree of uncertainty b  a permiss ion  May I speak to him now?  Might I speak to him now?  very polite  b supposition   He may come a little later.  He might come a little later less certain  The two forms are not opposed in the meaning of possibility  due to circumstances where only may is used nor in the meaning  of disapproval or reproach where might alone is found.  e.g. You may find the book at the library.  You might have considered your parents feelings.   85. Notice the following set phrases with may and might  a May as well might  as well might just as well  infinitive  is a very mild and unemphatic way of expressing an intention. It is  also used to suggest or recommend an action.  e.g. I may as well take the child with me.       .                . You may as well give him the letter.  I might as well stay at home tonight  Ill go at six. Thats far too late you might just as well  not go at all.             . b It might have been worse means Things are not so bad after  all. In  Russian  it is rendered  as      or         .  c  might have been a... means He might have been taken  for a... He looked like a... . e.g. Roy Wilson the new doctor was twenty -eight large heavy  mature and blond. He might have been a Scandinavian sailor - d f   may say so... has become a stereotyped phrase in which  the meaning of permission is co nsiderably weakened.  e.g. If I may say so I think you have treated him very badly.   86. In addition to the above cases illustrating the independent  use of may this modal verb occurs in subordinate object clauses  after expressions of fear as well as in a dverbial clauses of purpose  and concession. Here it is structurally dependent for a detailed  treatment of this use of may see Verbs  135 143 152.  e.g. I fear he may fall ill.  He is coming here so that they may discuss it without delay.  However col d it may be well go skiing.  can and may c ompared   87. The use of can and may is parallel only in two meanings  possibility due to circumstances and permission. In these mean - ings however they are not always interchangeable for a number  of various rea sons.  1 Thus in the meaning of possibility due to circumstances the  use of  may is restricted only to affirmative sentences whereas can is found in all kinds of sentences.  May  Can He may find this book at the  He can find this book at the  library.  library.  Can he find this book at the  library?  He cannot find this book at the  library.  Their time reference is also different. May refers only to the  Present or future the form might is used in past -time contexts  only in reported speech. Can could may refer to  the present  Past or future.  May  Can He may find the book at the  He can find the book at the  library.  library.  I said that he might find the He could find the book at the  book at the library.  library yesterday.  He can find the book at the  library tomorro w. Both could and might combined with the Perfect infinitive in - dicate that the action was not carried out in the past.  e.g. He might have found the book at the library.  He could have found the book at the library.  It follows from the above that the spher e of application of can in this meaning is wider than that of may.  2 When may and can express permission the difference be - tween them is rather that of style than of meaning   may is more  formal than can which is characteristic of colloquial English.  Cf. May might I speak to you for a moment professor?  Can could I have a cup of tea Mother?  May in negative sentences expressing prohibition is uncommon.  must   88. The modal verb must has only one form. It is used in  present -time contexts with reference  to the present or future and  in combination with the Perfect infinitive it refers to the past. In  past-time contexts this form is used only in reported speech i.e.  the rules of the sequence of tenses are not observed with must.   89. Must has the followi ng meanings  1 obligation from the speakers point of view  e.g. You must talk to your daughter about her future.  Must he do it himself?  In different contexts must may acquire additional shades of  meaning such as duty or necessity.  In this meaning must  is found in affirmative and interrogative  sentences and followed only by the simple infinitive.  2 prohibition  e.g. He must not leave his room for a while.          .  This meaning is expressed in negat ive sentences and must is also followed by the simple infinitive.  Note Absence of necessity in Russian       is ex - pressed by other verbs see to have and need.  3 emphatic advice  e.g. You must come and see us when youre in Lon don. You must stop worrying about your son.  You mustnt give another thought to what he said.  You mustnt miss the film. It is very good.  You must have your hair cut. Its much too long.  You mustnt cry.  This meaning is found in affirmative and negative se ntences  and is closely connected with the two above mentioned meanings.  4 supposition implying strong probability  e.g. He must be ill. He looks so pale.  It must be late as the streets are deserted.  Must in this meaning is found only in affirmative senten ces. In Russian this meaning is generally rendered by means of the  attitudinal adverbs      . In English this meaning may also be expressed by means of the  attitudinal adverb probably.   In this meaning must may be followed by different form s of the infinitive. If reference is made to the present the Continuous  infinitive is used with dynamic verbs.  e-g. The book is not on the shelf. Jane must be reading  it. Lets have something to eat. You must be starving.  If must is followed by the simpl e infinitive of dynamic verbs  it expresses obligation.  e-g. Jane must read the book.  You must stay here.  However with stative verbs the simple infinitive is used to  express supposition.  e.g. He must be over fifty.  He must know all about it as he has rea d a lot on the subject.  Must in combination with the Perfect infinitive refers the ac - tion to the past.  e.g. Do you see him smoking over there? He must have finished  his work.  It is six oclock. She must have come home.  The combination of must with the Pe rfect Continuous infini - tive indicates an action begun in the past and continued into the  moment of speaking.  e.g. It must have been raining all the night. There are big pud - dles in the garden.  However if must is followed by a stative verb the Perfect in- finitive is used.  e.g. He must have been here since breakfast.  He must have known it all along.  Note. Occasionally the combination of must with the Perfect Continuous infini - tive may express an action going on at a given past moment.  e.g. He must have  been writing a letter when I came.  When must expresses supposition implying strong probability  its use is restricted in two ways  a It is not used with reference to the future. In this case we  find attitudinal adverbs in the sentence.  e.g. He will proba bly come tomorrow.  He will evidently know all about it.  b It is not used in the interrogative or negative form. It is  found only in the affirmative form.  Note. To express supposition implying strong probability with negative mean - ing in addition to atti tudinal adverbs the following means are employed  e.g. He must have failed to get in touch with her.  He must have misunderstood you. He must be unaware of that.  He must never have guessed the truth.  No one must have told him about it.   90. Note the fol lowing set phrases with must.  a Must needs denotes obligation.  e.g. He must needs go there.     .  b  must be going and  must be off both mean it is time for  me to go in Russian     . c  must tell you that... and  must say... are stereotyped  phrases in which the meaning of obligation is considerably weak - ened in must.  d In the sentences You must come and see me some time.  You must come and have dinner with me. You must come to our  party. You must come and stay wi th us for the week end and the  like the meaning of obligation in must is also weakened. Must  has become part of such sentences which are a common way of ex - pressing invitations.  must and may Compared   91. Must and a can be compared in two meanings  1 Both may and must serve to express supposition but their use  is not parallel. May denotes supposition implying uncertainty where - as the supposition expressed by must implies strong probability.  Cf. For all I know h e may be an actor. His face seems so familiar.  He must be an actor. His voice carries so well.  I saw him an hour ago. He may still be in his office now.  He always comes at 10 sharp. So he must be in his office  now.  2 May and must are used to express prohi bition in negative  sentences. But may is seldom found in this meaning. In negative  answers to questions with may asking for permission we generally  find must not or cannot.  e.g. May I smoke here? No you mustnt you cant.  to have to   92. To have to  as a modal verb is not a defective verb and  can have all the necessary finite forms as well as the verbals.  e.g. He is an invalid and has to have a nurse.  She knew what she had to do.  I shall have to reconsider my position.  He is always having to exercis e judgement.  My impression was that he was having to force himself to talk.  I have had to remind you of writing to her all this time.  The women at Barford had had to be told that an experiment  was taking place that day.  As a matter of fact he said Iv e been having to spend  some time with the research people.  It wouldnt have been very nice for the Davidsons to have to mix with all those people in the smoking -room.  Having to work alone he wanted all his time for his research.  The interrogative and neg ative forms of the modal verb to have  to are built up by means of the auxiliary verb to do.1 e.g. Why do I have to do everything?  Did he have to tell them about it?  Thats all right she said. I just thought Id ask. You  dont have to explain.  There wa s a grin on his face. He did not have to tell me that  he already knew.   93. The verb to have to serves to express obligation or neces - sity imposed by circumstances. It is rendered in Russian as  -    . In this meaning it is found in all k inds of sentences   af- firmative interrogative and negative   and is combined only  with the simple infinitive.  e.g. He had to do it. Did he have to do it? He did not have to do it.  In negative sentences to have to denotes absence of necessity  compare wi th the negative form of must which expresses prohibi - tion.  1 The interrogative and negative forms of the modal verb to have to built up without  the auxiliary do are uncommon in American English and infrequent in British English - e.g. You dont have to g o there.     -   .  You mustnt go there.       .  94. In spoken English the meaning of obligation and necessi - ty is also expressed by have has got to. Like the verb to have to  it is found in all kind s of sentences and is combined with the sim - ple infinitive.  e.g. He has got to go right now.  Has he got to go right now?  He hasnt got to go just yet.  This combination may also be found in the past tense though  it is not very common.  e.g. He had got to sell his car.   95. Note the set phrase had better.  e.g. A few drops began to fall. Wed better take shelter she  said.     . She didnt like to say that she thought they had better not  play cards when the guest might come in at any moment.  Had better is followed by the infinitive without to. to be to  96. To be to as a modal verb is used in the present and past tenses.  e.g. We are to meet at six.  We were to meet at six.   97. To be to as a modal verb has the following meanings  1 a previously arranged plan or obligation resulting from the  arrangement  e-g. We are to discuss it next time.  We were to discuss it the following week.  Is he to arrive tomorrow?  Who was to speak at the meeting?  This meaning of to be to is found in affirmative and interro - gative sentences in the present and past tenses. To be to is fol - lowed by the simple infinitive.  The past tens e of the verb to be to in combination with the  Perfect infinitive denotes an unfulfilled plan.  e.g. I promised to go to a club with her last Tuesday and I really  forgot all about it. We were to have played a duet together.  2 orders and instructions ofte n official frequently in report - ed speech  e.g. I just mention it because you said I was to give you all the  details I could.  Norman says I am to leave you alone.  All junior officers are to report to the colonel at once.  In this meaning to be to is foun d in affirmative and negative  sentences and followed by the simple infinitive.  3 something that is destined to happen  e.g. He was to be my teacher and friend for many years to come.  He did not know at the time that he was never to see his na - tive place again.  Its been a great blow to me that you havent been able to  follow me in my business as I followed my father. Three  generations that would have been. But it wasnt to be.  This meaning of to be to is rendered in Russian as  . It is mainly found in the past tense and its application is limited to  narration. It occurs in affirmative and negative sentences and is  followed by the simple infinitive.  4 possibility  e.g. Her father was often to be seen in the bar of the Hote l Metro  pole.  Where is he to be found?  Nothing was to be done under the circumstances.  In this meaning to be to is equivalent to can or may. It is used  in all kinds of sentences in the present and past tenses and is fol  lowed by the passive infinitive.   98. Note the following set phrases with the modal verb to be to  What am I to do?   ?   ?  What  is to become  of me?    ?     ?  Where  am I to go?    ?      ?  99.  be to in the form of were to  infinitive for all per - sons is found in conditional cla uses where it is structurally depen - dent for a detailed treatment of this use of the verb to be to see Verbs  149.  e.g. If he were to come again I should not receive him.  musty to have to and to be to Compared   100. The verbs must to have to and to be to have one mean - ing in common that of obligation. In the present tense the verbs  come very close to each other in their use though they preserve  their specific shades of meaning. Thus must indicates obligation  or necessity from the speakers viewp oint i.e. it expresses obliga - tion imposed by the speaker.  e.g. I must do it.  want to do it.  He must do it himself. 7 shant help him.  To have to expresses obligation or necessity imposed by circum - stances.  e.g. What a pity you have to go now. Its time for you to catch  your train.  He has to do it himself. He has got no one to help him.  To be to expresses obligation or necessity resulting from an  arrangement.  e-g. We are to wait for them at the entrance. We have arranged  to meet there so we m ust wait for them at the appointed  place.  Sometimes the idea of obligation is absent and to be to ex- presses only a previously arranged plan.  e-g. We are to go to the cinema tonight.  Note. In public notices we find must because they express obligation i mposed  by some authorities.  e.g. Passengers must cross the railway line by the foot bridge.  The same is true of prohibition expressed in negative sentences  e.g. Passengers must not walk across the railway line.  Visitors must not feed the animals.  In the p ast tense however the difference in the use of the  three verbs is quite considerable.  Must has no past tense. It is used in past -time contexts only in  reported speech.  e.g. He said he must do it himself.  Had to  infinitive is generally used to denote an  action which  was realized in the past as a result of obligation or necessity im - posed by circumstances  e.g. I had to sell my car. It was necessary for me to do it because  I needed money.  He had to put on his raincoat. It was raining hard out side  and he would have got wet if he hadnt.  Was were to  infinitive is used to denote an action planned  for the future which is viewed from the past. The action was not  realized in the past and the question remains open as to whether it  is going to take place . e.g. We were to meet him at the station. It is not clear from the  sentence if the action will take place.  If the speaker wishes to make it clear at once that the plan  was not fulfilled the perfect infinitive is used to show that  e.g. We were to have met him at the station. That means that  we failed to meet him.  However the simple infinitive may also be used in this case.   101. In reported speech in past -time contexts must remains  unchanged in all of its meanings.  e.g. He said he must do it witho ut delay.  He said I mustnt tell anyone about it.  The doctor told her that she must eat.  They believed the story must be true.  Parallel to must had to  infinitive is also used occasionally  reported speech to express obligation.  . He said he had to make a telephone call at once.  In this case had to is close to must in meaning it does not in - clude the idea of a realized action but refers to some future moment.  Note. Care should be taken not to replace must by had to in reported speech as  two verbs expres s different meanings see above.  ought to   102. The modal verb ought to has only one form which is used  with reference to the present or future. In reported speech it re- ins unchanged. Ought is always followed by the infinitive with to.  103. Ought to has the following meanings  1 obligation which in different contexts may acquire addi - tinal shades of meaning such as advisability and desirability  . You ought to say a word or two about yourself.  Ought she to warn him?  He oughtnt to mention it to a nybody.  In this meaning ought to is possible in all kinds of sentences  though it is felt to be awkward in questions where should is pre- ferred.  Generally ought to refers an action to the future and is fol - lowed by the simple infinitive. With reference t o the present ought  to is used with the continuous infinitive or with the simple infini - tive if the verb is stative.  e.g. At your age you ought to be earning your living.  You ought to feel some respect for your elders.  In combination with the perfect infi nitive ought to in the affir - mative form shows that a desirable action was not fulfilled.  e-g. You ought to have chosen a more suitable time to tell me  this news.  He ought to have put everything off.  In the negative form ought to in combination with the Perfect  infinitive shows that an undesirable action was fulfilled.  e.g. Im sorry. I oughtnt to have said it.  You oughtnt to have married her David. It was a great mis - take.  2 supposition implying strong probability  e.g. The new sanatorium ought to b e very comfortable.  The use of ought to in this case is not very common as this  meaning is normally rendered by must.  Note the set phrases Heyou ought to know it he isyou are  supposed to know it. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  shall and should   104. Historically shall and should were two forms of the  same verb expressing obligation. 1 But later they came to express  different meanings and in present -day English their use is not par - allel  they are treated as two different verbs.  shall   105. In modern English the modal meaning of obligation in  shall is always combined with the function of an auxiliary verb of  the future tense.  Shall is still used to express obligation with the second and  third persons but at present it is not common in this me aning in  spoken English. Its use as a rule is restricted to formal or even  archaic style and is mainly found in subordinate clauses i.e. it is  structurally dependent  e.g. It has been decided that the proposal shall not be opposed.  This book is sold sub ject to the condition that it shall not by  way of trade he lent resold hired out or otherwise dis - posed of without the publishers consent.  1 Shall was the present tense of the Indicative Mood should was the Subjunctive  Mood.  At present however th is meaning of obligation somewhat  modified is found with the second and third persons in sentences  expressing promise threat or warning. It is used in affirmative  and negative sentences and combined with the simple infinitive.  e.g. You shall have my ans wer tomorrow.  You shall stay just where you are! his mother cried angrily.  He shall do as I say.  The meaning of obligation may also be traced in interrogative  sentences where shall is used with the first and third persons to  ask after the will of the per son addressed. In this case it is also  followed by the simple infinitive.  e.g. Shall I get you some fresh coffee Miss Fleur?  Who shall answer the telephone Major?  Sentences of this kind are usually rendered in Russian with the  help of the infinitive      ?       ? etc. should   106. In modern English the modal verb should is used with  reference to the present or future. It remains unchanged in re - ported speech.   107. Should has the following meanings  1 obligation w hich in different contexts may acquire addi - tional shades of meaning such as advisability and desirability  e.g. Its late. You should go to bed.  You shouldnt miss the opportunity.  Should I talk to him about it?  Should in this meaning is found in all ki nds of sentences. Like  ought to it generally refers an action to the future and is followed  by the simple infinitive.  With reference to the present should is used with the Continu - ous infinitive or with the simple infinitive if the verb is stative.  e-g- You shouldnt be sitting in the sun. Move out of it into the  hade.  You shouldnt feel so unhappy over such trifles.  Should may be combined with the Perfect infinitive. In this  case the meaning of the combination depends on whether the sen - tence is affirm ative or negative. In an affirmative sentence should  Perfect infinitive indicates that a desirable action was not carried  out. e.g. He looks very ill. He should have stayed at home.  He should have told me about it himself.  In a negative sentence should  Perfect infinitive serves to  show that an undesirable action was carried out.  e.g. Oh Renny you shouldnt have done as you did!  They shouldnt have concealed it from us.  2 supposition implying strong probability  e.g. The film should be very good as it  is starring first -class  actors.  The use of should in this case does not seem to be very com - mon as this meaning is usually rendered by must.   108. In addition to the above mentioned cases showing the  independent use of should this verb occurs in certai n object  clauses where it depends on the lexical character of the predicate  verb in the principal clause and in adverbial clauses of condition  purpose and concession. Here its use is structurally dependent  for a detailed treatment of this use of the verb  see Verbs  129 131 138 140 143 149.  e.g 1 suggest that you should stay here as if nothing had happened.  Its important I broke out  that the Barford people  should know what weve just heard.  She was terrified lest they should go on talkin g about her.  Suddenly she began to cry burying her. head under the book  so that I shouldnt see.  If he should drop in give him my message.   109. Should may have a peculiar function   it may be used  for emotional colouring. In this function it may be cal led the  emotional should. The use of the emotional should is structurally  dependent. It is found in the following cases  1 In special emphatic constructions where a simple predicate  is not used  a in rhetorical questions beginning with why  e.g. Why should I do it?       ?  Why  shouldn t you invite  him?       -   ? b in object clauses beginning with why  e.g. I dont know why he should want to see George.           . I dont see why we shouldnt make friends  c in attributive clauses beginning with why after the noun  reason  e.g. There is no reason why they shouldnt get on very well to - gether.           .  I dont see any reason why h e shouldnt be happy  d in constructions of the following kind  e.g. The door opened and who should come in but Tom.         ?       . As I was crossing the street whom should I meet but Aunt  Ann.  e in the set phrase How should I know?     ?. In the above cases should may be followed by the Perfect in - finitive which in simple sentences refers the action to the past a  and in complex sentences shows that the action of the subordinate  clause prec edes that of the principal clause b.  e-g. a I went into business with her as her partner. Why shouldnt  I have done it?           ? b He did not know why he should have expected them to  look different.              . There were fifteen equally good reasons why she should  not have played bridge.   2 In certain types of subordinate clauses where should  in- finitive is interchangeable with a simple predicate in the Indica - tive Mood for the use of the Indicative Mood in these clauses see  Verbs  130  a in object clauses after expressions of regret surprise  sometimes pleasure or displeasure  e.g. Im sorry that you should think so badly of me.           .  was little surprised that Ann should speak so frankly  about it.  I am content that you should think so. The rules of the sequence of tenses are not observed here. The  Perfect infinitive is used to show that the action of the subordi  nate clause preced es that of the principal clause  e.g. I am sorry that you should have had a row with Kate about it.  He was annoyed that they should have asked him that  b in object clauses following the principal clause with it as a formal subject  e.g. It is absurd that  such things should happen to a family like  theirs.         -   .  It was strange that he should be asking those questions.  It struck him as exceedingly funny that his brother should  be in love.  In the principal clause we find such expressions as it is won - derful absurd monstrous natural odd queer singular strange  terrible and the like it infuriated outraged puzzled startled  surprised and the like me it struck me as funny etc. We also  find the following interrogative and negative expressions in  the principal clause is it possible likely probable? it is not possible  likely probable it is impossible improbable unlikely.  As we see from the above examples the rules of the sequence  of tenses are not observed here either.  If the action of the subordinate clause precedes that of the  principal clause the Perfect infinitive is used after should.  1 After the affirmative it is possible likely probable a simple predicate is used  e.g. It is inconceivable that Mrs Crosbie should have writt en such  a letter.  Its much better that you should have found everything out  before its too late.  It infuriated her that he should have spoken to her in such a  tone.  Note. Should  infinitive may be occasionally found instead of a simple predi - cate in so me other kinds of subordinate clauses but it is not in common use  a in predicative clauses  e.g. The part that interests me is that such a thing should happen to such people.  b in appositive clauses  e.g. The fact that he should have made such a brilli ant speech surprised me greatly.  c in constructions of the following kind  e.g. That it should come to this!     !   think that it should come to this!       !   think that it should have happened to me!   -      !   sum it up it should be said that as compared to the use of  a simple predicate in the Indicative Mood the use of should  in- finitive gives the statement emotional colouring such as surprise  amazement irritation indignation pleasure displeasure etc. i.e.  it emphasizes the speakers personal attitude towar ds the facts  stated in the sentence. The Indicative Mood represents these facts  in a more matter -of-fact way.  must should and ought to Compared  110. All the three verbs serve to express obligation. Must  however sounds more forceful peremptory.  e-g. Yo u must do it at once.       .  Both should and ought to express obligation advisability de - sirability and are used when must would sound too peremptory.  e-g- You should do it at once.       You ought  to do it at once .  .  Should and ought to are very much alike in meaning and are  often interchangeable. In using ought to however we lay more  stress on the meaning of moral obligation whereas should is com - mon in instructions and c orrections.  e.g. You ought to help him he is in trouble.  You should use the definite article in this sentence.  Notice that ought to cannot be used instead of the emotional  should.  111. Must ought to and should serve to express supposition  implying stron g probability. Must however seems to be in more  frequent use than the other two verbs.  should  Perfect Infinitive ought to  Perfect Infinitive  and waswere to  Perfect Infinitive Compared   112. Should  Perfect infinitive and ought to  Perfect infi n- itive show that the action has not been carried out though it was  desirable waswere to  Perfect infinitive indicates an action that  has not been carried out though it was planned.  e.g. You should have helped  him.             You ought to have warn hi m Now he is in trouble.  He was to have arrived last week. But his plans were upset  by some cause or other.  will and would  113. The verb will1 has the following forms will   the present tense and would   the past tense. The latter form is used  in two ways a in past -time contexts to express an actual fact and  b in present -time contexts to express unreality or as a milder and  more polite form of Will.  1 Will and would may also be used as verbs of full predication not modal verb - Will may be used as a regular verb wills willed. It means          . Would is a defective verb. It is used with reference to the  present and means  . It is found mainly in poetry and like the verb to wish  followed by an object clause see Verbs  132 e.g.  would I wer e a careless child  While shall and should are treated as two different verbs in  modern English will and would are considered to be the forms of  the same verb its original meaning being that of volition.J How - ever in some of their meanings the use of will is parallel only to  would which denotes an actual fact in the past in other meanings  will is found alongside would which expresses unreality in the  present or serves as a milder or more polite form of will.   114. The use of will and would which denot es an actual fact  in the past is parallel in the following cases  1 When they express habitual or recurrent actions  e.g. She will would sit for hours under the old oak tree looking  at the beautiful country around her ...    -        ....  In addition to indicating a habitual action will would in this  case implies willingness personal interest on the part of the doer  of the action. Will would in this meaning is found in affirmative  sentences and is followed by the simple infinitive.  In present -time contexts will in this meaning is not common. In  past-time contexts would is mainly characteristic of literary style.  e.g. Then there were weekends when he would ride over to the  house of one farmer or another and spend a couple of nights  on the hills.  2 When they express refusal to perform an action  e.g. The doctor knows I wont be operated on.  He was wet through but he wouldnt change.  This meaning is found in negative sentences will would is followed by the simple infinitive. In Russian it is usually ren - dered as           . 3 When they are used with lifeless things to show that a  thing fails to perform its immediate function.  e.g. My fountain pen wont wouldnt write.  The door wont woul dnt open.   Volition is a general term which includes such meanings as willingness readi - ness consent intention and determination to perform an action.  In this meaning will would is found in negative sentences  and is followed by the simple infinit ive. In Russian it is usually  rendered as                  and the like.  4 When they are used with the first person to express will in - tention or determination  e.g. Damn it! he thought Im going to get out of this hole. I  will make money.  I am an Englishman and I will suffer no priest to interfere in  my business.  I said I would do anything for him.  We decided that we wouldnt interfere.  This meaning is found in affirmative and negative sentences.  The present tense will in addition to expr essing its modal meaning  serves to refer an action to the future the past tense would is gen - erally used in reported speech and also serves to refer an action to  the future but in this case it is viewed from a past moment.   115. The use of will and would which expresses unreality in  the present or serves as a milder or more polite form of will is parallel in the following cases  1 in interrogative sentences where they express willingness  consent  e.g. Will you dine with me tomorrow Lewis?  Wont you sit down? said the doctor.  Youll forgive me wont you?  Would you do it? she asked eagerly.  2 in clauses of condition introduced by if see also Verbs.   149 where they also express willingness consent  e.g. Its about forty minutes walk from he re and if youll come  now Ill go with you she said.  No we are not going to quarrel at all if youll only let me talk. If you would stand by me I should have another try.  In both cases will would is followed by the simple infinitive  and the action alw ays refers to the future.  Both interrogative and conditional sentences are often actually  polite requests in this case. There is hardly any difference be - tween the use of will and would here the role of would is to make  the request still more polite.   116. The use of will and would is not parallel in the follow - ing cases  1 Will may be used to express supposition with reference to  the present or to the future in combination with the simple infini - tive or to the past in combination with the Perfect i nfinitive. This  meaning is found with the second and third persons.  e.g. This will be the school I believe.   -    .  You will have heard the news Im sure.        .  It should be noted that the use of will in this meaning is not  common.  2 Would may be used rather sarcastically to express that  something wa s to be expected. It is found in affirmative and neg - ative sentences.  e.g. Auntie Meg has been very brave. Yes. She would be brave.  That was to be expected of her under the circumstances.  I dont understand him and I dont approve of his decision.  No you wouldnt.  did not expect you would.  This meaning can be rendered in Russian as       . 3 Note the use of will in the following sentences  e.g. Boys will be boys.   .  Accidents  will happen .         -  . 4 Note the set phrases with will and would  a Will not have wont have followed by an object and an in - finitive without to means Ill see to it that it does not happen.  e-g. I will not wont have you speak to me like that her voice  came sharply.      ... b Both would rather d rather and would sooner d sooner  followed by an infinitive without to mean to prefer.  e.g. Id rather do it myself said Luke.  Hed sooner die than let me think he was a failure.  e Would... mind in interrogative and negative sentences means  to object.  e.g. Would you mind my staying here for a while?  I wouldnt mind your telling them about Hardy.  Would...mind in interrogative sentences may also express a  polite request.  e.g. Would you mind getting me a cup of tea?   117. Would also occurs in cert ain subordinate clauses where  it is structurally dependent for a detailed treatment of this case  see Verbs  132.  e.g. I wish the rain would stop for a moment.  I wish they wouldnt insist on it.  need   118. The modal verb need may be used either as a defective  or as a regular verb.  1 Need as a defective verb has only one form which is the  present tense. In reported speech it remains unchanged. It is fol - lowed by the infinitive without to. Need expresses necessity. When reference is made to the  presen t or future it is followed by the simple infinitive. It is used  in negative and interrogative sentences.l In interrogative sentences need usually implies that there is no  necessity of performing the action.  e.g. You neednt be afraid of me.       .  You need not meet him unless youd like to.  Need  I repeat  it?      ?  1 Occasionally it may be found in affirmative sentences but it is not typical.  In negative sentences it is not always the verb need that is in  the negative form the negation may be found elsewhere in the  sentence.  e.g. I dont think we need give her any more of our attention.  I need hardly say that I agree with you.  In combination with the Perfect infinitive need expresses an  action whi ch has been performed though it was unnecessary. It im - plies a waste of time or effort.  e.g- You neednt have come. The deal is off.        .     . It was obvious. You neednt have protested.  We neednt have told him a lie even if we didnt want to tell  him the truth .         ...    ...  Note. Note t hat the Russian sentence           is rendered in English as You neednt worry be nervous.  2 As a regular verb need can have all the necessary forms in - cluding the verbals. It also expresses necessity. It is fol lowed by  the infinitive with to and is mainly used in interrogative and nega - tive sentences like the defective need.  e.g. He did not need to explain.  You dont need to tell me that you are sorry.  Did you need to read all those books?  It should be noted that this need is in more common use than  the defective need particularly in American English.  Note. The regular verb need may be followed by a noun or pronoun. But in this  case to need is not a modal verb.  e-g. He needs a new coat.  Does he need my help?  He does not need anything.  dare   119. The modal verb dare may also be used as a regular and  as a defective verb.  1 Dare as a defective verb has two forms which are the present  and the past forms. It means to have the courage or impertinence  to do somet hing. Its use is very restricted. In present -day English  it is mainly found in questions beginning with how which are actu - ally exclamations and in negative sentences.  e.g. How dare you say that!  How dare she come here!  How many years is it since we da nced together? I darent think.  He dared not look at her.  2 Dare as a regular verb has all the necessary forms includ - ing the verbals. It has the same meaning as the defective dare. Its use is also restricted. It is mainly found in negative sentences.  e.g. He does not dare to come here again.  She told me she had never dared to ask him about it.  No one dared to live in the house since.  3 Note the colloquial set phrase  dare say.  e.g. I dare say I looked a little confused.  My son is not in town but I dar e say he will be before long.  In Russian this phrase is usually rendered as            . shouldnt  Perfect Infinitive oughtnt to  Perfect  Infinitive and neednt  Perfect infinitive Compared   120. Shouldnt  Perfect infinitive and oughtnt to  Perfect  infinitive show that an action has been carried out though it was  undesirable neednt  Perfect infinitive indicates that an action  has been carried out though it was unnecessary.  e.g. You shouldnt have come because you are ill.  You oughtnt to have written to them because your letter up - set them.  You neednt have come because the work is finished.  You neednt have written to them because I sent them a  telegram.  Expressions of Absence of Necessity   121 . The main verbs expressing necessity are must to have  to to be to should and ought to.  Yet care should be taken to remember that the verbs must to  be to should and ought to in their negative forms do not express  absence of necessity see the use of these verbs above.  Absence of necessity is expressed by the negative forms of to have to and need.  In the present tense  e.g. You dont have to go there.  You neednt go there.  The two verbs generally differ in that neednt  infinitive in- dicates that th e speaker gives authority for the non -performance  of some action whereas dont doesnt have  infinitive is used  when absence of necessity is based on external circumstances.  Cf. You neednt come here. Ill manage everything without your  help.  You dont have to come to the Institute tomorrow. There  will be no lectures tomorrow.  In the past tense where the regular form of the verb need is found the two verbs are similar in meaning. They both indicate  that there was no necessity and hence no action.  But to need is not in common use.  e.g. You did not have to go there.  You did not need to go there.  Note. Care should be taken not to use You neednt have gone there as an ex - pression of absence of necessity because it means that an action was carried out  though it was unnecessary.  FORMS EXPRESSING UNREALITY   122- As has been said above owing to certain historical chang - es. we find a variety of forms expressing unreality in present -day English see also Verbs  73.  These forms are  1 the plain ste m of the verb for all persons a survival of the  old Subjunctive Mood  e.g. Ivory insisted that he be present in the most friendly fashion  imaginable.  They proposed that he borrow the money from the bank.  2 were for all persons also a survival of the o ld Subjunctive  Mood  e.g. I wish I were ten years younger.  3 the form of the Past Indefinite  e.g. He looked as if he knew about it.  4 the form of the Past Perfect  e.g. He looked as if he had seen a ghost.  5 should for the first person singular and plural  or would  for the other persons  infinitive  e.g. If I had a garden I should grow tulips in it.  If he had a garden he would grow tulips in it.  6 should for the first person singular and plural or would  for the other persons  Perfect infinitive  e.g. If it hadnt rained I should have gone for a walk.  If it hadnt rained he would have gone for a walk.  7 should for all persons  infinitive  e.g. I insist that he should meet us at the station.  8 would for all persons  infinitive  e.g. I wish he wouldnt interrupt me. 9 may might  infinitive  e.g. Im telling you this so that you may write to your parents  about it.  I told you that so that you might write to your parents  about it.  10 can could  infinitive  e.g. Im  telling you this so that you  can write to your parents  about it.  I told you that so that you could write to your parents  about it.  11 were to for all persons 4- infinitive  e.g. If he were to discover the truth he would never speak to us  again.   123. All these forms denoting unre ality may be subdivided  into two groups according to their meaning.  Some of them are used to represent an action as hypothetical  i.e. the speaker does not know whether the action will take place  or not the realization of the action is doubtful questiona ble. e.g. Most of them insisted that the proposal be discussed without  delay.  They suggested that Meg should stay with them for another  week.  Other forms express actions contradicting reality i.e. actions  which cannot be realized.  e.g I wish I had seen t he procession.  If I were a writer I should write detective stories.   124. The forms described above can be classified in the fol - lowing way  1 Of all the forms expressing unreality only one may be found  in the same syntactic structures as the Indicative  Mood. The choice  between the two forms is based on meaning see also Verbs  154 -159.  This form is built up analytically by means of the auxiliary  verbs shouldwould  infinitive. Although should is generally used  for the first person singular and p lural and would for the other  Persons there is a strong tendency in present -day English to use  Would for all persons. This fluctuation in the use of should and Would disappears in spoken English where the contracted form d  infinitive is used.  The for m has two tenses the present tense shouldwould  in finitive which is used with reference to the present or future a  and the past tense shouldwould  Perfect infinitive which refers  the action to the past b.  e.g. a I should be glad to see him if I had a chance.  b I should have been glad to see him if I had had a chance.  The use of should be glad in a is opposed to the Indicative  Mood in  am glad to see him or  shall be glad to see him. The use  of should have been glad in b is opposed to the Indicative Mood  in  was glad to see him.  Similarly He would go there with pleasure if it were possible  is opposed to He will go there with pleasure He would have gone  there with pleasure to He went there with pleasure.  This form may be called the Conditional Mood. It represents  an action as contradicting reality. The action is unreal because it  depends on an unreal condition as the condition cannot be real - ized the action that depends on it cannot be fulfilled either.  In accordance with its mean ing the Conditional Mood is often  used in the principal clause of a complex sentence of unreal condi - tion.  e.g. If he were not ill he would come.  If he had not been ill he would have come.  2 The only forms of the old Subjunctive Mood that have sur - vived  in English are  a The form of the plain verb stem for all persons. It repre - sents an action as hypothetical. It is used only in certain types of  subordinate clauses see Verbs  129 131 140.  e.g. He proposed that the plan be adopted.  It is necess ary that you say it in his presence.  This form has no tense distinctions. In its use it is inter - changeable with should  infinitive in definite types of subordi - nate clauses and is mostly found in American English.  Traditionally this form is called the Subjunctive Mood.  b The form were for all persons. It serves to show that an ac - tion contradicts reality and is also used in certain types of subor - dinate clauses but not in the same types as the form of the plain  verb stem see Verbs  132 133 136 144 146.  e.g- If I were you I should not accept his offer.  I wish he were here.  The form were refers the action to the present or to the future.  In some syntactic structures it is now often replaced by was.  3 As the formal difference between the I ndicative Mood and  the Subjunctive Mood has in many cases disappeared the forms of  the Past Indefinite a and the Past Perfect b came to express  unreality in English.  a The form of the Past Indefinite is used to express an action  contradicting reality  with reference to the present or future. This  use of the Past Indefinite is found in certain types of subordinate  clauses see Verbs  132 133 136 144 146.  e.g. If I knew it I should tell you about it.  I wish I knew it.  Thus the Past Indefinite performs two different functions in  English its main function is to represent an action as a fact re - ferring to the past but it may also represent an action as contra - dicting reality with reference to the present or future.  Further in describing the us e of the forms of unreality the  form were will be included among the forms of the Past Indefinite  because they are used in the same constructions and with the same  meaning. It should be mentioned that were with the first and third  persons singular is ofte n replaced by was in present -day English.  b Parallel to the use of the form of the Past Indefinite the  form of the Past Perfect came to represent actions contradicting re - ality in the past. The Past Perfect is used in the same types of sub - ordinate cla uses as the Past Indefinite when it expresses unreality.  e.g. If I had known it I should have told you about it.  I wish I had known it.  Thus actions contradicting reality are expressed in present -day English by means of tense shift. The Past Indefinite is  used to ex - press unreality in the present the Past Perfect has the same  function in the past.  4 Other means of expressing unreality in present -day English  a combinations of modal verbs with an infinitive. They are  Mainly found in definite types of su bordinate clauses see Verbs  129 131 132 135 138 140 143 149.  e.g. He suggested that we should join them.  If he were to get the job he would go on with his studies.  It should be noted that the modal phrase should for all per - sons  infinit ive is used in the same sentence patterns as the  Subjunctive Mood. The two forms exist side by side.  e.g. I suggest that he go should go with us.  It is necessary that he go should go with us.  In British English the difference between the two forms is s ty- listic should  infinitive is in common use and may be found in  any style whereas the use of the Subjunctive Mood is restricted  to the language of official documents and to high prose. In Amer - ican English the Subjunctive Mood is generally preferred .  125. To sum up all the forms described above it is possible  to say that unreality is expressed in present -day English by the  following means  a by mood forms  b by the tense shift  c by modal phrases.   126. All these means of expressing unreality may have the continuous a and passive b forms if the lexical meaning of the  verb admits of that and when it is required by the situation.  e.g. a If he were not reading now wed turn on the radio.  If he were in Moscow they would be showing him the city.  He look ed at me as if he were wondering what they had on  their minds.  b They proposed that the meeting be adjourned should be  adjourned.  If he had been sent for at once he might have saved us a lot of trouble.  He wished he had been told about it.   127. Before  describing the use of the various forms of unre - ality it is necessary to understand the factors which determine  their choice.   1 Sometimes the choice between the Indicative Mood and this  or that particular form of unreality depends on the structure of  the sentence mainly on the type of the subordinate clause in  which this form occurs and in certain cases even on the lexical  character of the predicate verb in the principal clause. This may  be termed as the structurally dependent use of forms expressing  unreality.  2 In other cases the choice is independent of the structure of  the sentence and is determined by the attitude of the speaker to - wards the actions expressed in the sentence. This may be termed  as the independent or free use of forms expressing unreality.  3 In a limited number of cases the use of forms expressing  unreality has become a matter of tradition and is to be treated as  set phrases as other sentences cannot be built up on their pat - terns. This may be termed as the traditional use of forms ex- pressing unreality.  The following will be a description of forms expressing unreal - ity in accordance with this division.  Structurally Dependent Use of Forms  Expressing Unreality  The Use of Forms Expressing Unreality in Object Clauses   128. In object c lauses the use of different forms of the predi - cate depends on the lexical character of the predicate verb in the  principal clause.  As a rule we find the Indicative Mood in object clauses after  most verbs.  e.g. We know that he is doing very well in his  studies.  They thought that he had given up his idea.  He said that he would soon be back.  As is well known the rules of the sequence of tenses are to be  observed here.  Note. Care should be taken to remember that in object clauses after expressions  of regret surprise sometimes pleasure or displeasure the emotional should can be  used alongside the Indicative Mood see Verbs  109 2a.  129. However after certain verbs and expressions we find  forms of unreality in object clauses.  Thus should  infinitive or the Subjunctive Mood is used after  expressions of suggestion order or decision such as to decide to  demand to give instructions to give orders to insist to make up  ones mind to move to order to propose to recommend to re  quest to req uire to suggest to urge and also after to arrange to  be anxious to be determined to prefer and to take care.  e.g. Con demanded that Andrew should return to the house with  him to tea.  She urged that they go to Europe.  He had given instructions that eve rything possible should be done.  He was determined that they should see everything.  But if I write about war self -respect demands that occasion - ally I share the risks.  He requested me as a favour that I should report to him any  points of interest that I might pick up on my visits  there.  The situation required that he be courteous.  In all those cases the action of the subordinate clause follows  the action of the principal clause. Therefore this should is never  combined with the Perfect infinitive.  Objec t clauses after expressions of order and suggestion are  generally introduced by the conjunction that asyndetic connection  is less frequent. The rules of the sequence of tenses are not ob - served in object clauses of this type.  e.g. They proposed that th e issue should be discussed in a week.  They proposed that the issue be discussed in a week.   130. In object clauses subordinated to the principal clause  with it as a formal subject we find the Indicative Mood after such  expressions as it is wonderful n atural strange singular absurd - terrible monstrous queer odd etc.  it infuriated outraged - startled surprised puzzled me and the like. The Indicative Mood  is also used after it is possible likely probable in affirmative  sentences.  e.g. But i ts natural that you come to get used to things.  Its just possible that .he left them alone.  Its wonderful that you carry such petty details in your head.  Its hardly likely that anyone will bother to go into it this af - ternoon.  Clauses of this kind are  usually introduced by the conjunction  that asyndetic connection is not common.  Care should be taken to observe the rules of the sequence of  tenses when the Indicative Mood is used.  e.g. It is strange that he behaves like that.  It was strange that he beha ved like that.  It is strange that he behaved like that at the party.  It was strange that he had behaved like that at the party.  Note. As has been shown in  109 2 the emotional should may be used in the  above cases too. In contrast to the Indicative Mood  it adds emotional colouring to the  statements though in both cases actual facts are referred to. However after it is pos  sible likely probable in affirmative sentences the Indicative Mood is the rule.   131. Yet after certain other expressions in t he principal  clause the modal phrase should  infinitive or the Subjunctive  Mood is always used in the object clause. They are expressions of  necessity or recommendation such as it is necessary important  vital imperative essential urgent advisable desirable we also  find these forms after the Passive Voice of some verbs expressing  suggestion order decision such as it is suggested proposed re - quired demanded requested recommended decided agreed deter - mined arranged.  e.g. It is necessa ry at times that certain persons should be encour - aged.  It is necessary that they be careful in the lab he added.  It is advisable that she should have someone to keep an eye  on her  Its so important that they should know the right things  from the beg inning Isabel had explained.  It was agreed beforehand that he should have the first shot.  He says its quite essential that you do it after supper.  Its been suggested that I should join one of the public ser - vices.  In all those cases the action of the  subordinate clause follows  the action of the principal clause. Therefore should is never com - bined with the Perfect infinitive in such constructions.  As a rule object clauses after all those predicates are also intro - duced by the conjunction that asyndetic connection is not common.  Note that the rules of the sequence of tenses are not observed  when should  infinitive or the Subjunctive Mood is used.  e.g. It is arranged that he have should have the lab all to himself.  It was arranged that he have s hould have the lab all to  himself.   132. In object clauses after the verb to wish we find the form  of the Past Indefinite or the form were or the Past Perfect to ex - press a wish which cannot be fulfilled or a hardly realizable wish.  e.g. I wish I dese rved your compliments. I dont.  I wish you had asked me anything but that.  I wish it were true.  I wished that Thomas hadnt brought me there.  Note. For a realizable wish other verbs and constructions are used  e.g. I want to see him.  I want him to come.  I should like to talk to you.  I should like him to call me up.  I wish to see it for myself.  I wish him to do something for me.  Object clauses after the verb to wish are usually joined to the  principal clause asyndetically though sometimes the conjunction  that is found.  The rules of the sequence of tenses are not observed in this  construction. In object clauses after the verb to wish the tense  forms indicate the following  a The use of the Past Indefinite form shows that the action of  the subordinate clause is simultaneous with that of the principal  clause  e.g. I wished he were with us.  b If the action of the subordinate clause precedes that of the  principal clause the form of the Past Perfect is used.  e.g. I wished he had stayed at home.  c When the action of the object clause follows that of the  principal clause we find the modal verbs would  infintive might   infinitive and could  infinitive in the subordinate clause.  e.g. I wished the child would show more affection for me.  I wished I could  drop the whole matter.  I wished you might stay with us a little longer.  Note 1. However could  infinitive and might  infinitive may also be used to  express a simultaneous action.  e.g. I wish 1 could understand you.  I wish he might be here.  Note 2. It should be noted that would  infinitive is not common with the  first person.  As all these forms express an unrealizable wish they serve as  expressions of regret rather than wish. That is why they may be  rendered in Russian in two ways. Thus the sentence  wish I knew  it where the actions in both clauses are simultaneous may be  translated as         or          . When the action of the subordinate clause  precedes that of the principal clause there is only one way of ren - dering such sentences in Russian namely    .. . For example the sente nce  wish I had told him about it is translated  as            . Thus where the  verb in the object clause is affirmative in English it is negative in  Russian and vice versa.  e.g. I wish I had told him the truth.           . I wish I hadnt acted like that.      .  When the action of the subordinate clause follows that of the  principal clause it is not necessary to translate the modal verbs  into Russian the usual way of ren dering such sentences is     ... . e-g. I wish he would tell me everything.          .  I wish I could might go round the world.     -    .  Note. I wish you would  infinitive has become a set phrase and is an equiva - lent of the Imperative Mood it is emotionally coloured.  e.g. I wish you would keep quiet.  I wish you would stop it.  Compare it with the Russian       .  133. After the idiomatic phra se it is time also it is high  time it is about time we find the form of the Past Indefinite or  the form were.  e.g. Now lets talk. Yes she said quietly its time we did  Arnie.     Its high time we got rid of our old furniture.      Its high time you were in bed too my child.  He said Its time we ordered dinner.  Clauses of this kind are usually joined to the principal clause  asyndetically.  The rules of the sequence of tenses are not observed in this  kind of clauses.  e.g. Its time we had lunch.  It was time we had lunch.   134. After expressions of fear such as to be afraid to be fear - ful to be frightened to be in terror to be nervous to be terrified  to be troubled to fear to have apprehension to tremble and others  we commonly find the Indicative Mood in the object clause. Care  should be taken to observe the rules of the sequence of tenses.  e.g. I am afraid nothing has been done yet. She was afraid that he had seen her. I was afraid you were going to strike him.  135. Occasionally we also find may  infinitive in object  clauses after expressions of fear. The rules of the sequence of  tenses are also observed in this case.  e.g. Shes afraid he may miss his only chance.  She was afraid he might miss his only chan ce. But in literary style object clauses are sometimes introduced  by the conjunction lest. In this case should  infinitive rarely the  Subjunctive Mood is used in the object clause. The rules of the  sequence of tenses are not observed here.  e.g. They w ere terrified lest someone should discover their secret  hiding place.  An hour before his train was due he began to have apprehen - sion lest he should miss it. He seemed nervous lest in thus announcing his intentions  he should be setting his granddaughter  a bad example.   136. In object clauses introduced by the conjunctions if and whether after expressions of doubt and negative expressions we  sometimes find the form were.  e.g. He would wonder for a moment looking into her shining  eyes if it were true.  He did not ask himself if  she were pretty.  When they were back in their seats Maurice asked Adeline if she were still enjoying the play.  Generally we find the Indicative Mood in such clauses the use  of the above mentioned form is characteristic of literar y style it  is a survival of the old use of the Subjunctive Mood.  The Use of Forms Expressing Unreality  in Appositive and Predicative Clauses   137. In appositive clauses which are usually introduced by  the conjunction that the use of different forms of th e predicate  depends on the lexical character of the noun they modify.  As a rule the Indicative Mood is found in this kind of clauses.  The rules of the sequence of tenses are to be observed in this case.  e-g. The idea that he thought himself anything but i ntelligent  was absurd.  He is under the impression that I am hiding something from  him.   138. But should  infinitive or rarely the Subjunctive Mood is  used in appositive clauses after nouns expressing order suggestion  wish agreement and decision su ch as agreement ambition decision  demand desire order proposal recommendation request require  ment suggestion understanding wish and some others.  e.g. He told me of his desire that all should be happy as long as it  involved no inconvenience to himself.  He had supported them for years but on the understanding  that they should live in Europe.  Im afraid youll have to go to him with the suggestion that he dismiss the case.  There was no likelihood that anyone should be there.  The rules of the sequ ence of tenses are not observed in this case.   139. The same rules hold good for predicative clauses   gen- erally the Indicative Mood is used in them.  e.g. The question is how we are going to find the means to do it.  The fact was that I hardly knew what to say.  The trouble is that he didnt find him in.  The rules of the sequence of tenses are observed in this case.   140. But when the subject of the principal clause is ex - pressed by one of such nouns as aim arrangement condition de - cision idea plan  proposal suggestion wish and some others  should   infinitive is used in the subordinate clause. The rules of  the sequence of tenses are not observed  e.g. My suggestion is that as soon as the rain lets up we should  go along there and see what we can d o. His desire was that life should fall in with his own limited  but deliberate plans.  The Use of Forms Expressing Unreality  in Adverbial Clauses   141. Forms expressing unreality are found in clauses of pur - pose comparison concession and in both the pri ncipal and the  subordinate clause of a conditional sentence.  Adverbial Clauses of Purpose   142. An adverbial modifier of purpose is usually expressed  by an infinitive when the agent of that infinitive is the same as  the subject in the sentence.  e.g. He s aid that he was going out to buy some stationary.  He went up to his room to change.  The infinitive may sometimes though not often be preceded  by in order or so as.  e.g. I had to keep drinking coffee in order to stay awake.  Youd better wait outside so as  to be at hand if I want you.  So as is more often used to introduce a negative infinitive  e.g. She sat still so as not to disturb the dog.   143. A subordinate clause of purpose is found when the sub - ject of this clause is not the same as the subject of the principal  clause.  Clauses of purpose are introduced by the conjunction so that  sometimes that or in order that both of which are characteristic  of literary style and so which is colloquial. The predicate in  these clauses is expressed by may or can  infinitive and the  rules of the sequence of tenses are to be observed in this case.  e.g. As you go leave the door open so that the light from the  lamp may show you some of the way down.  She dressed quickly for dinner so that she might see him the  soone r. Youll have to come into the hospital so that we can keep you  under observation.  He slid out of bed felt his way over to the door of the room  and opened it a little so that he could hear what the wom - en were saying.  If the verb in the subordinate cla use is in the negative form  should  infinitive is preferred.  e-g. I stood up my back turned so that he should not see my face.  Sit down he said dropping his voice so that the two men  in the room should not hear.  In literary style we sometimes find clauses of purpose intro - duced by the conjunction lest  ... . l In this case should  infinitive rarely the Subjunctive Mood is used in the subordinate  clause. As the conjunction lest is negative in meaning the verb is  in the affirmative form  e.g. An access of joy made him shut his eyes lest tears s hould  flow  from  them  ...     .   withdrew his eyes lest she should read them.  Lest he freeze he wore a ragged sweater over the ensemble.  The rules of the sequence of tenses are not observed here.  Sometimes though not often th e Indicative Mood the Future  Indefinite is used in adverbial clauses of purpose instead of mod - al phrases.  e.g. I too want to live in London so that the children will have  someone to turn to in case anything should happen to them.  She gave him the key  so that he would lock the car.  Adverbial Clauses of Comparison   144. In clauses of comparison introduced by the conjunctions  as if or as though we find the form of the Past Indefinite includ - ing the form were for all the persons or the Past Perfect.  The form of the Past Indefinite or Continuous shows that  the action of the subordinate clause is simultaneous with the ac - tion of the principal clause.  e.g. He asked me the question as if the answer were really impor - tant to him.  He looks as though he had  plenty of determination.  They passed her in silence with their noses in the air as though she did not exist.  Her lips moved soundlessly as if she were rehearsing.  Note. In contemporary English the form were is sometimes replaced by was in the 1st and 3d persons singular  e.g. He behaves as if he was the boss here.  1 This conjunction should not be confused with the homonymous conjunction lest which is used to introduce object clauses after expressions of fear. The latter is not  negative in meaning.  The form of the Past Perfect Continuous shows that the action  of the subordinate clause precedes the action of the principal clause.  e.g. Bosinney gazed at him as though he had not heard.  The dog rushed at me and licked my hands in a frenzy of de - light as if I had been away a long time.  He sounded breathless on the telephone as though he had  been running.  If the action of the subordinate clause follows the action of  the principal clause would  infinitive is used.  e.g. She sank back on her chair and leaning  her head on her hands  began to weep as though her heart would break.  She looked up at me defiantly as if she would turn on me that  very moment.  The rules of the sequence of tenses are not observed in such  clauses.  Note 1. Compare complex sentences with a clause of comparison in Russian and  in English.  e.g.         .   She looked  at me as if she did not recognize me.               .   spoke of the film  as if he had seen it.  In Russ ian it is generally necessary to use the correlative  in the principal  clause whereas in English it is not required.  Note 2. Clauses introduced by as if and as though are treated as predicative  clauses when they follow the verbs to look to sound to f eel. e.g. At first he sounded as though he were trying to avoid a scene.  She was so ill that for days it looked as if she would die.  The man looked as though he had once been a miner.  Complex Sentences with a Subordinate Clause of Condition   145. Complex sentences with a subordinate clause of condi - tion conditional sentences1 may be divided into two groups sen - tences of real condition and sentences of unreal condition.  1 In conditional sentences forms expressing unreality are used in both the princi - pal clause and in the subordinate clause the if -clause whereas in all the previously  described types of sentences  forms expressing unreality are found only in subordinate  clauses.  In sentences of real condition we find the Indicative Mood.  They usuall y refer to the future so the Future tense is used in  the principal clause and the present tense in the if -clause.  e.g. If you continue in this way youll break your mothers heart.  You wont be believed if you tell the truth.  Sentences of real condition m ay also refer to the present or  past though not very often.  e.g. I always lose money if I bet. In the evenings we played chess or strolled about if it was  fine.  It should be noted that sentences of the latter kind express  regularly occurring actions.  Clau ses of condition are usually joined to the principal clause  by means of the conjunction if and are therefore called if -clauses.  There are other conjunctions which serve to introduce clauses of  condition but their use is not so common. They are unless in  case supposing suppose that providing provided that on condi  tion that.  Note. If has the most general meaning of all the conjunctions introducing  clauses of condition. Its use is not restricted in any way whereas all the other  conjunctions are lim ited in their application either for semantic or stylistic rea - sons. Roughly unless means if. ..not.  However there is a difference between  them unless has the more exclusive meaning of only if... not or except on con - dition that. The most adequate  way of rendering this conjunction in Russian is      . e.g. We never part with things you know unless we want something in their place.  Does the professor know? No. And he wont unless it is absolutely neces - sary.  While if ... not can be u sed instead of unless though the clause will be de - prived of the above mentioned specific shade of meaning unless cannot always  serve as a substitute for if ... not. For example unless cannot be used in the follow - ing sentence  e.g. If your wife doesn t like the ring Ill be happy to exchange it any time.  In case also has a specific shade of meaning implying purpose as well as condi - tion. It should be rendered in Russian as  mm    . e.g. Id like the doctor handy in case she feels worse.  Ive made provision in case anything happens to me.  Supposing that and suppose that preserve the meaning of supposition as  their origin from the verb to suppose is still stro ngly felt. They are best of all ren - dered in Russian by means of   and are found in the following kinds  of sentences  e.g. Suppose he doesnt turn up what shall we do?  What will his uncle think of him supposing its true?  Providing that and provided that are rather narrow in meaning indicating a  favourable and desirable condition which is explained by their connection with the  verb to provide. Besides they are rather formal stylistically being more typical of  official documents. The clos est Russian equivalents are        . e.g. But so long as a Forsyte got what he was after he was not too particular about  the means provided appearances were saved.  We are prepared to sign the agreement providing that you guarantee the high  quality of the good s. On condition that is also connected with its original meaning    and at the same time it is restricted stylistically being more formal than if. e.g. I will agree to this years budget on condition that we drop this foreign busi - ness in fu ture. All these conjunctions may be used in sentences of both real and unreal condition.   146. In sentences of unreal condition we find forms express - ing unreality the form of the Past Indefinite or the Past Perfect  is used in the if -clause and the Con ditional Mood Present and  Past is used in the principal clause.  The action of the if -clause is represented by the speaker as con - tradicting reality consequently the action of the principal clause  which depends on this unreal condition cannot be reali zed either.  When a sentence of unreal condition refers to the present or  future the form of the Past Indefinite is used in the if -clause and  the Present Conditional Mood in the principal clause.  e.g. How nice it would be for Mother if we had a car.  You ou ght to know your uncle by this time. Hes just like a  child. Hed be a pauper tomorrow if I didnt see to things.  If the hospital were not so overcrowded he said he would  recommend that she should be taken there.  When a sentence of unreal condition refer s to the past we  find the form of the Past Perfect in the if -clause and the Past  Conditional Mood in the principal clause.  e.g. It would have been too wonderful if he had said that. But he  didnt.  Of course all this wouldnt have happened if the girl hadnt  been so excited.  I should have been sorry if I hadnt spoken.   147. Note the following construction which may be used with  reference either to the present or to the past.  e.g Oh Maurice went on if it werent for my mother I should  be unhappy at  home.  Mrs Davidson was saying she didnt know how theyd have  got through the journey if it hadnt been for us she said.  If it were not for his friend Crowdy he would be in financial  difficulties.   148. The if -clause and the principal clause need no t necessar - ily refer to the same time the if -clause may refer to the present  and future and the principal clause may refer to the past and  vice versa. Sentences of this kind are called a split condition.  e.g. If you were not so indifferent to him you would have noticed  that there was something happening to him.  You must remember if Mr Reed hadnt taken me out of the drawing office I should be there now getting two pounds a  week.   149. Sentences of unreal condition referring to the future  may be of four  types l 1 The first type has already been described the Past Indefi - nite is used in the if -clause and the Present Conditional Mood in  the principal clause.  e.g. Half of the people would distrust you if you went away at  such a moment.  If we allowed him to go on with his experiments we would  never have any peace.  1 Conditional sentences referring to the future no matter what forms of the verb  are used in them are always hypothetical because one can never be sure of the actual  course of events in the f uture. But these future actions may be represented differently  by the speaker either as an actual fact when the Indicative Mood is used or as  actions contradicting reality or problematic actions see  149.  The action is represented in such sentences as contradicting  reality   the speaker does not believe that it can be realized in  the future.  2 As the above type of conditional sentences may refer to both  the present and the future there is a strong tendency in English  to use another type which is un ambiguous in order to show that  the action refers only to the future and not to the present.  In this type of conditional sentences we find the form were of the modal verb to be to followed by an infinitive in the if -clause.  In the principal clause the Con ditional Mood is used.  e.g. Mother would resist it bitterly if I were to ask for breakfast  at this hour.  If we were to take this man in hand for three months he  would become as soft as wax.  If young Adeline were to occupy the room it would look so differen t. If Meg were to repay you the fifteen dollars you lent her  what would you do with the money?  He had lately thought much about what he would do if he were to meet them.  This second type differs from the first type in that it em - phasizes the tentative ch aracter of the condition.  3 Should  infinitive is used in the if -clause and the Future  Indefinite of the Indicative Mood in the principal clause.  e.g. I dont expect any telephone calls tonight. But if anyone  should call the butler will say Ive gone on  a visit to some  of my relatives.  If the other conclusion should be correct the slight loss of  time will make no difference.  The Imperative Mood may also be used in the principal clause.  e.g. Better employ a solicitor. Sir in case anything should arise.  If she should leave keep an eye on her.  This third type of conditional sentences referring to the fu - ture differs from the first two types in that it shows that the re - alization of the action is represented as possible though unlikely  but not contradict ing reality as in the first two types. The  if-clause  of the third  type may be rendered  in Russian  as   -   ...      -    ...     -   ... . We may  say that the realization of the action depends on some contingency.  In this type of sentences the clause of condition i s rather often  introduced by the conjunction in case.  e.g. Ill let you know in case there should be some unavoidable  delay.  I ll be at the flat all evening in case you should change your  mind.  The clause of condition introduced by this conjunction ac - quires the meaning of            . 4 Sometimes would  infinitive is used in the if -clause and the  Present Conditional Mood in the principal clause.  e.g. If he would only trust me we would get on much better.  Id love it if you would call me Eliza.  Woul d  infinitive expresses consent or willingness      ...      .... A sentence of this type is often a conditional sentence only in  form it is actually a polite request see the last example above.   150. The modal verbs can and may can also be found in con - ditional sentences. If they occur in if -clauses referring to the  present or future they have the past form.  e.g. If I could be a writer I should write detective stories.  His bedroom is very cold. If I might move him i nto your  study he would feel more cheerful there.  In the principal clause we generally use the Conditional Mood.  But as can and may are defective verbs and cannot be used in the  Conditional Mood the past tense of these verbs is used in combi - nation with the simple infinitive to refer the action to the present  or future.  e.g. I could try to make the place comfortable with more heart if  the sun were shining.  If you had any office training it might be possible to use you  up here.  When reference is made to t he past could and might are com - bined with the Perfect infinitive both in the if -clause and in the  principal clause.  e.g. Yet if she could have seen me there she would have been a  little puzzled.  If I hadnt been there something very unpleasant might have  happened to him.   151. A clause of unreal condition may be joined to the prin - cipal clause asyndetically. In that case it always precedes the  principal clause and we find inversion in the subordinate clause  the auxiliary verb is placed before the subject.  e.g. Had Irene been present the family circle would have been  complete.  Should you want to do so you can withdraw your money at  any time.  As is seen from the above examples asyndetic connection is  possible only when the predicate of the subordin ate clause is an  analytical form or a modal phrase. This construction is emphatic  and characteristic only of literary style.  Complex Sentences with Adverbial Clauses of Concession   152. Complex sentences with a clause of concession intro - duced by the c onjunction even if or even though are built up on  the same pattern as sentences of unreal condition   the form of  the Past Indefinite or the Past Perfect is used in the subordinate  clause and the Conditional Mood Present or Past in the principal  clause.  e.g. But even if you were right I should be prepared for any con - tingency.  Even if I had been a stranger he would have talked of his  misfortune.  Note. In complex sentences with a clause of concession introduced by though  although whoever whichever wh atever whenever however wherever no matter  how the Indicative Mood is used in both clauses.  e.g.. And when we settle down wherever it is youll have a garden Chris.  In literary style may might  infinitive is occasionally used in clauses of con - cession to lay stress on the meaning of supposition.  e.g. Whatever his invitation may mean Im going to accept it.  He said he would be glad to fulfil the conditions whatever they might be. The Use of Forms Expressing Unreality  in a Special Type of Exclama tory Sentences   153. The form of the Past Indefinite including the form  were is used in the following type of exclamatory sentences to ex - press a wish which cannot be fulfilled.  e.g. Oh if only Daddy were home!  Oh if only I knew what to do!  In the abov e examples reference is made to the present. With  reference to the past the form of the Past Perfect is used  e.g. Oh if only he had given me a chance!  When the sentence refers to the future we find would  infini - tive or could  infinitive  e.g. If it would only stop raining for a single day!  Oh if only you would see a doctor!  If only their life together could always be like this!  Sentences of this kind are very emphatic and restricted to spo - ken English.  Free Use of Forms Expressing Unreality   154. The choice of forms expressing unreality which has  been described above depends on certain kinds of clauses and  sometimes on the lexical character of the verb in the principal  clause. However other forms expressing unreality may be used  freely independent  of any particular sentence pattern. They are  opposed to the Indicative Mood and their choice is determined by  the speakers attitude towards the action in question.   155. If an action is represented as an actual fact the Indica - tive Mood is used. But i f it is dependent on some implied unreal  condition i.e. an unreal condition which is not expressed by an if- clause but understood from the sentence or the context the Con - ditional Mood is used to represent the action as contradicting re - ality. This use of the Conditional Mood is often found in simple  sentences.  The Present Conditional Mood is used with reference to the  present or future.  e.g. Are you intending to marry her? I think it would be very  unwise. She would be a load on you. The implied c ondi - tion is if you married her.  I wouldnt sell the picture for ten thousand dollars. It would  be a crime to sell such a picture.  I think it would be a very bad precedent to let him cut the  end of term.  When the situation refers to the past the Past Conditional  Mood is used.  e.g. Twenty years ago I would have strongly disapproved of you.  The implied condition is if it had been twenty years ago.  He would have said a great deal more but he was tired.  Shes a different woman now. I should never have  thought it possible.   156. The modal verbs can and may which cannot have ana - lytical forms are used in the form of the past tense to express  unreality. With reference to the present or future they are fol - lowed by the simple infinitive.  e-g. Hes nev er asked me about it though he knows I could never  tell him a lie.  With his office training he might find a job with us.  When reference is made to the past could and might are com - bined with the Perfect infinitive.  e-g. There was a wonderful concert at t he Victoria Hall we could  have gone to. But we missed it.  Why on earth didnt he send to say that he was ill? We  might have helped him.   157. Sometimes the unreal condition is not merely implied  but actually expressed in the sentence by means of a specia l ad- verbial modifier of condition.  e.g. But for you I would give up everything.  Id never have got a job like that off my hands but for your help.  But for... is rendered in Russian as    ...  158. The Conditional Mood and the forms could and might  are used not only in simple sentences but also in any kind of  clauses with implied condition for example in attributive claus - es object clauses adverbial clauses etc. They are al so found in  the principal clause of a complex sentence.  e.g. And yet Butler was the last man in the world with whom you  would have associated romance.  I know he wouldnt have enjoyed Le Roys story.  To his surprise Mrs Garnet was not so much opposed to the  notion as he would have expected.  In the old days she would have tried to make him see why  she had done it.   159. Sometimes the Conditional Mood and the forms could  and might are found in sentences without implied condition. Their  use in this case differ s from the use of the Indicative Mood only  stylistically   they serve to lend the sentence a milder and more  polite shade of meaning the Past Conditional expressing the high - est degree of politeness  e.g. How long did you wait? I would say a good five  minutes.  Ask Miss Thompson when it would be convenient to see her. I suppose Im prepared to accept their offer. I should  think you are.  Why I should have thought there could be no two answers  to that.  I should have said he is nothing out of the ord inary.  Do you know Walter Gray? Could you write to him?  Compare it with the similar use of the Subjunctive Mood in  Russian    ...     ...      ...   This function of the Conditional Mood and of the forms could  and might plays a n important role in spoken English.   160. There are a few other modal verbs and set phrases which  are the Subjunctive Mood or the Conditional Mood only by origin.  How they have ceased to express unreality. They are the modal  verbs should and ought to and the set phrases had better would  rather would sooner should would like.  e.g. Dont you think Sybill ought to have her tonsils seen to?  Will you do it? she asked him in an uneasy tone. Oh Id much rather you did it he said.  She decided that they  had better stay in town for another week.  I shouldnt like to have a nature like yours Alec his wife  She should be pleased with what she has.  Note. Note that in object clauses after would d rather the same forms are  used as after the verb wish.  e.g. Hed rather they left him alone.  Id rather he hadnt spoken in that abrupt manner.  The above modal verbs and set phrases do not express actions  depending on some unreal condition. They merely lend the sen - tence a milder and more polite shade of meaning . Traditional Use of Forms Expressing Unreality   161. The Subjunctive Mood and the form were may be found  in simple sentences. Their use in this case is based on tradition.  The Subjunctive Mood is now only found in a few set phrases  which are a survival o f the old use of this mood. New sentences  cannot be formed on this pattern.  a The Subjunctive Mood serves to express wish in the follow - ing kinds of sentences.  e.g. Long live the Queen!  Success attend you! Be ours a happy meeting!  God bless you. Heaven forbid.  Note. We also find may  infinitive in sentences of this kind.  e.g.. May success attend you!  May ours be a happy meeting.  b The Subjunctive Mood serves to express concession in the  following sentences which can be treated as set phrases in modern  English.  e.g. So be it.    . Come what will.     . Note. Concession may also be expressed by parenthetic phrases with may and let. e.g. Happen what may...    ...    ...  Be this that as it may...      ... Let it be so.     . c The Subjunctive Mood is found in the expressions Suffice to  say that...   ... and Far be it from  me...     ....  e.g. Far be it from me to contradict you.  d The Subjunctive Mood is also used in certain imprecations  e.g. Manners be hanged.       . e The form were is found in the set phrase as it were      which is used parenthetically.  e.g. Her portrait had been as it were stamped on his heart.  They were silent and as it were oppressed.  f Would  infinitive is found in as luck would have it o       or as ill luck would have if       . e.g. As luck would have it I was invited for that night . The Tense Forms Expressing Unreality  Summary   162. As can be seen from the above description not all the  forms of unreality can express tense distinctions. Thus the Sub - junctive Mood and the modal phrases should for all persons 4- in- finitive and would for all persons  infinitive have no tense dis - tinctions. They are used only in certain types of subordinate  clauses and generally show that the action of that clause follows  the action of the principal clause i.e. they express time relatively - e.g. I suggested that he take up the matter.  It is was important that he should accept the offer.  I wished he would agree to see me.  Since these forms have no tense distinctions the rules of the  sequence of tenses are not observed here.  Tense distin ctions are expressed only by the forms of the Con - ditional Mood which has two tenses   Present and Past and also  by the use of the forms of the Past Indefinite and the Past Perfect.  The Present Conditional Mood and the form of the Past Indefi - nite als o the form were for all persons singular serve to refer an  action to the present or future when they are used in complex sen - tences with a clause of condition or a clause of concession intro - duced by even if or even though.  e.g. If I had time I should  go on a short holiday.  If he were younger he would go on an expedition again.  Even if he knew about it he wouldnt tell us. The Past Conditional Mood and the form of the Past Perfect  serve to refer an action to the past in the same kinds of clauses.  e.g. If I had had time I should have gone on a short holiday.  If he had been younger he would have gone on an expedition  again.  Even if he had known it he wouldnt have told us. The Present Conditional Mood is used with reference to the  present or future also i n simple sentences with implied condition  while the Past Conditional refers an action to the past.  e.g. It would not be possible to decide anything without him.  It would not have been possible to decide anything without him.  In all those cases the tenses are used absolutely i.e. they refer  an action directly to the present past or future  The same is true of the modal verb were to  infinitive which  is used only in  -clauses and refers an action of that clause to the  future.  e.g. If everybody were to be  brought up differently would the world not change?  But when all the forms which in the above described cases ex - Press time relations absolutely are used in other subordinate  clauses they become relative tenses i.e. they express the time  with regard  to the action of the principal clause. The Present  Conditional Mood and the form of the Past Indefinite indicate  that the action of the subordinate clause is simultaneous with  that of the principal clause or follows it.  e.g. They say said it would be impossible to decide anything  without him.  I wished I knew it. The Past Conditional Mood and the form of the Past Perfect  show that the action of the subordinate clause precedes that of the  principal clause.  e.g. They say said it would have been impossib le to decide any - thing without him.  I wished I had known it. It should be remembered that the tenses in sentences of unreal  condition are also used relatively in reported speech  e.g. He says said that if he had time he would go on a short hol - iday.  He says said that if he had had time he would have gone on a short holiday.  As is seen from the examples the rules of the sequence of  tenses are not observed with any of the above mentioned forms  expressing unreality.  Things are different however with  the forms can may  in- finitive used to express problematic actions. Can is found in  clauses of purpose may   in clauses of purpose and in object  clauses after expressions of fear in the principal clause.  e.g. On Sundays we always go outing so that th e children can  may spend the day in the open air.  I am afraid that he may get angry with me.  The forms can may  infinitive are in the Indicative Mood  here so the rules of the sequence of tenses should be observed  e.g. On Sundays we always went outin g so that the children could  might spend the day in the open air.  I was afraid that he might get angry with me.  VERBALS NON -FINITE FORMS OF THE VERB   163. There are three verbals in English the infinitive the  ing-form and the participle.  The infini tive is a plain verb stem which is usually preceded  by the unstressed particle to e.g. to take. In addition to the sim - ple form the infinitive has the following analytical forms con- tinuous   to be taking perfect   to have taken perfect continu - ous  to have been taking simple passive   to be taken perfect  passive   to have been taken.  The ing-form  is built up by adding the suffix -ing to the stem of  the verb e.g. to take   taking for spelling rules see Verbs  ll. The ing-form also has ana lytical forms perfect   having tak - en passive   being taken perfect passive   having been taken.  The participle of regular verbs is formed by adding the suffix  -ed to the stem for spelling rules and the pronunciation of the  suffix see Verbs  5. The participle of irregular verbs may be  formed in different ways see Verbs  5 and Appendix.  The participle has only one form   it is invariable.   164. In order to understand the nature of the verbals it is  necessary to compare them with the finite forms of the verb and  bring out points of similarity points of difference between them.  As the infinitive and the ing-form  have many features in com - mon they will be compared with the finite forms together.  The participle which differs from both these f orms conside - rably will be compared with the finite forms separately.  The Infinitive and the ing-form   165. The infinitive and the ing -form have the same lexical  meaning as the finite forms of the corresponding verb.  But with regard to their grammatical  categories the two ver - bals correspond to the finite forms only partly.  1 The infinitive and the ing -form lack the forms of person  and number characteristic of the finite forms.  2 Mood can be expressed only by the finite forms.  It should be pointed out howe ver that although the infinitive  has no special mood forms and cannot represent an action either  as a real fact or as something unreal it may in some functions  express certain modal meanings   necessity possibility purpose  e.g. a necessity   Ive go t something dreadful to tell you.  b possibility   I had nobody to talk to.  c purpose   Im going upstairs to pack my things.  The Perfect infinitive in combination with some modal verbs  may sometimes show that its action was not realized in the past.  e.g. The y should have told him about it.  3 Like the finite forms the infinitive and the ing-form have  active and passive forms e.g. to take   to be taken taking   be ing taken.  Like the finite forms the infinitive and the ing -form can ex - press time e.g. to take  to have taken taking   having taken.  Yet the two verbals differ considerably from finite verbs in  this respect. The finite forms generally express time absolutely.  i.e. they refer an action to the present past or future e.g. He knows English. He  knew English. He will know English. The ver - bals express time relatively i.e. in relation to the action of the  predicate verb in the sentence. The action expressed by the verbals  may be simultaneous with the action expressed by the predicate  verb a may precede b or follow it c.1 e.g. a He seemed to know all about it.  Roger was at home working on his speech.  b He seemed to have guessed the truth.  Having looked at his watch he closed the book and put it  on the shelf.  c He was ready to assist the m. One afternoon about half past five when Thomas was  counting on working for an hour or two more the tele - phone rang.  Besides the simple forms of the verbals themselves are capa - ble of expressing all kinds of time relations. The various time re - lations they express depend on the lexical character of the verb  and on the context.  1 It is true that the finite forms may also express time relatively but that occurs  only in certain sentence patterns.  The infinitive tends to express an action following t hat of the  predicate verb a but it may also denote an action simultaneous  with it b. However the simple form of the infinitive does not often  express an action that precedes the action of the predicate verb c.  e.g. a He felt a quick impulse to cal l the boy back.  b She was admiring his ability to concentrate on any task.  c Sylvia was glad to run across her old schoolmate.  The ing-form tends to express actions simultaneous with that  of the predicate verb a. But it is also extensively used to expr ess priority b and sometimes an action following that of the predi - cate verb c.  e.g. a This Saturday afternoon Henry home from his office sat  at his study table drawing cats on the blotter waiting  for his wife to come back from a lunch.  b I remembered hearing my aunt telling me in my childhood  that great men never cared for flattery. 1 c She insisted on coming with me but I finally managed to  talk her out of it.  The time relations expressed by the passive forms are the same  as those of the cor responding active forms.  On the whole it should be noted that it is the simple form of  the verbals that is in extensive use in English. The analytical ing- forms are infrequent but they are commonly used with modal  verbs in some of their meanings  e.g. He must be happy now.  He must be sleeping.  He must have misunderstood you.  He must have been waiting for you.  The experiment must be finished already.  The experiment must have been carried out by now.  In other cases the continuous infinitive is generally u sed only  to emphasize the idea of duration of process and to make the  statement more vivid and expressive. A simple infinitive is often  possible in the same sentence.  1 Here the action of hearing precedes the action of the predicate verb remembered  the u se of the perfect Ing-form  is an exception.  e.g. It was pleasant to be driving the car again.  Im not a man to be talking of what does not concern me.  It would be possible to use the simple forms to drive and to talk in the above examples.  The perfect in finitive is more or less frequent after verbs of  mental perception the verbs to seem to happen to appear and a  few others. It shows that the action took place before the action of  the predicate verb.  e.g. Their marriage was supposed to have been a very happy one.  A sense of timing is one of the things I seem to have learned  from Jimmy.  The Perfect Continuous infinitive is mainly found after the  same verbs as the Perfect infinitive. It shows that the action of  the infinitive began before the time indicate d by the finite verb  and is still going on.  e.g. She was believed to have been feeling unwell for some time.  They seemed to have been getting on a bit better.  The forms of the two verbals are summed up in the following  tables  The Infinitive    Active  Passi ve Simple  to take  to be taken  Perfect  to have taken  to have been taken  Continuous  to be taking   Perfect Continuous  to have been taking   The ing -form    Active  Passive  Simple  taking  being taken  Perfect  having taken  having been taken   166. The inf initive and the ing-iorm like the finite forms  are always associated with a subject but the way their subject is  expressed differs greatly from that of the finite forms.  Since the finite forms have the function of the predicate in the  sentence their sub ject is always the grammatical subject of the  sentence. But the subject of the verbals may be expressed differ - ently.  In a number of functions the subject of the verbals is the  same as the subject of the sentence and consequently of the fi - nite verb.  e.g. He struggled to find the first words of his story.  She wasnt used to being miserable without doing something  about it.  But in certain other functions the subject of the verbal is fre - quently expressed by some secondary parts of the sentence.  e.g. He gave her permission to leave.  Seeing you there by the door made me remember what I  had to do.  For the most part she was silent the effort of speaking was  too much for her.  Moreover the subject of the infinitive and the ing-form  may be  found in a neigh bouring clause or even in a different sentence.  e.g. She told him what a wonderful place it was to take her to.  There was a vast useless stretch of time to fill. I occupied  my mind with the memories of my childhood.  Starting this relationship seems to me o ne of the better  things youve ever done however it ends.  You wont do the same thing again will you? I cant ex - plain but having done it just once is enough.  In all the above cases the relation between the action of the  verbal and its subject beco mes clear from the context as the sub - ject is not expressed by any grammatical means.  Occasionally the subject of the verbal is not indicated at all  it is not found either in the sentence itself or in a wider context.  In this case it is understood as an y or every person or as an indefi - nite number of unidentified persons.  e.g. Knowledge is not something to boast about.  Writing good prose is not easy.  Finally a verbal may have a subject of its own specially ex - pressed in the sentence. The way the sub ject is expressed is differ - ent in this case for the infinitive and for the ing -form.  The subject of the infinitive is expressed by a noun or an in - definite pronoun in the common case or by a personal pronoun in  the objective case. It precedes the infini tive and the whole con - struction is introduced by the preposition for. e.g. Im not going to make a spectacle of myself for people to talk  about.  For a bachelor to have such well -trained servants was a prov - ocation to the women of the district.  It was ra re for him to go out to dinner.  He was too embarrassed for us to ask him about anything.  This kind of construction is called the f or-phrase.  The subject of the ing -form may be expressed in four different  ways by means of a possessive pronoun a a person al pronoun in  the objective case b a noun in the genitive case c and a noun or  an indefinite pronoun in the common case d.  e.g. a I appreciate your coming to my defense.  b I just couldnt complain about him and be the cause of him  losing the job.  c Do you recall Richards doing that?  d She was worried by a stranger staring at her from a dark  corner.  The ing -form with its subject is called the ing-complex.  But the four complexes differ with regard to the frequency of  their occurrence and their stylistic  colouring.  Possessive pronouns are in current use whereas the use of per - sonal pronouns in the objective case is less frequent and distinctly  colloquial. Conversely we generally find nouns in the common case  while nouns in the genitive case are by far less common and main - ly typical of literary style.  Note. Note the pattern in which the subject of the ing -form is introduced by  there.  e.g. We spoke about there being no one at the moment for him to turn to for help  Verbals like the finite forms can b e used in the active and in  the passive. Accordingly their subject may be either the doer  agent of the action expressed by the verbal or may undergo this  action be acted upon.  e.g. I have not come here to be insulted but to talk to you as a  friend.  I watched her for a little while without being seen.  He left us without saying good -bye.  The two different kinds of subject may be called the active  subject and the passive subject of the infinitive or of the ing- iorm.   167. With regard to their meaning and  function the infini - tive and the ing -form like the finite forms can be classed into  two groups  1 They can serve as notional verbs.  e.g. It amused him to tease the girl.  He went downstairs holding on the banister.  2 They may also serve as structura l words. Some of them  mainly the verb to be may be used as link -verbs.  e.g. He is said to be a good chap.  Tom said something about it being pretty late.  The verb to have may be used as a modal verb.  e.g. Well Im sorry to have to tell you that.  He looke d at his wrist -watch and talked about having to  make a few calls before the visitor arrived.  The infinitive and the ing -form may also be used as auxiliary  verbs to build up analytical forms e.g. to be taking to have tak - en to have been taking etc. having taken being taken etc. Both verbals are widely used as second or third components  of analytical finite forms.  e-g. She will be there.  She is working.  She has been reading.   168. The syntactic functions of the verbals and those of the  finite form s do not coincide and therein lies the main difference  between them.  The finite forms as has been said have one function in the  sentence   that of the predicate. The verbals may perform a vari - ety of functions. The most striking feature of the infinitiv e and  the ing -form is that they have functions typical of different parts  of speech. Sometimes they have noun functions e.g. the function  of the subject or the object.  e.g. To know all about English is one thing to know English is  quite another.  Everyth ing youve planned to do is sensible.  Reading with us is the thing that we cannot do without.  If this is what you intend asking me stop wasting your time.  The infinitive and the ing-form  may also have adjective func - tions e.g. the function of an attrib ute.  e.g. He was not a man to do rash things.  Singing people arm in arm filled the street.  The two verbals can also perform adverbial functions e.g. the  function of an adverbial modifier of purpose consequence time  manner.  e.g. I came here to discu ss matters with you.  I had only to hear her voice to know what she felt.  After hesitating a moment or two Jim knocked on the door.  You begin learning a language by listening to the new sounds.  The infinitive and the ing-form may also have purely verbal  functions. This occurs in two different cases  a In certain sentence patterns they may serve as the predicate  of the sentence.  e.g. Why not go with me?  What about having a look at my new house?  b As is well known in the absolute majority of English sen - tences the predicate is expressed by a finite verb. But the infini - tive and the ing -form may serve to express a second action accom - panying the action expressed by the predicate verb.  e.g. I woke to find Maud cooking a meal and found.  He took a seat next to mine watching my face with close at - tention and watched.  The infinitive and the ing -form may also serve as parenthesis  i.e. have the function performed by attitudinal adverbs.  e.g. To tell the truth Im beginning to find her a bore.  Frankly speaking Im at a loss.   169. In some of their functions the infinitive and the ing- form are lexically dependent. That means that their use is required  by definite verbs nouns and adjectives. For example the verb to want requires an infinitive as obje ct e.g. He wanted to see them  at once. while to avoid requires an ing -form in this function e.g.  For some time she avoided even mentioning their names.. The same is true of the adjectives ready and busy that require an infin - itive and an ing -form resp ectively. Cf. He was ready to do any- thing for her. She was busy packing her things.  Besides the infinitive and the ing-form are in some functions  also structurally dependent i.e. they occur in quite definite sen - tence patterns. For example the infi nitive or the ing -form are  found after a number of definite verbs nouns and adjectives only  in sentences with it as a formal subject.  e.g. It was a relief to be in the car again.  Its no use going on like that he said in an angry tone.   170. Although the syntactic functions of the infinitive and  the ing -form differ from those of the finite forms the two verbals  can be modified by the same secondary parts of the sentence as  the predicate verb.  e-g. He told me about it himself.  He wanted to tell me abou t it himself.  He insisted on telling me about it himself.  He saw her there alone yesterday.  He wanted to see her there alone yesterday.  He told me about seeing her there alone yesterday.  If a verb requires a prepositional object the preposition is re - tained by the verbal when the object happens to be separated from it.  e.g. Weve got a lot to talk about.  Im not accustomed to being spoken to in that way.  Yet there is a difference between the two verbals and the finite  forms. With finite forms the second ary parts of the sentence usu - ally follow the predicate but they may also have front position.  e.g. That year winter set in early.  To relieve my feeling I wrote a letter to Robert.  With the infinitive and the ing -form the secondary parts are  always fou nd in post -position. The verbals may be preceded only by  certain adverbs. Yet even instances of this are infrequent  e.g. Critically to examine newcomers was one of the amusements  at the boarding house.  My father was the coach of our swimming team though his poor health prevented him from ever going into the water.  With finite forms the negatives not and never normally ei - ther follow them or are placed within analytical forms of various  kinds of compound predicates.  e.g. He was not there.  He has not done  it. He should not do it. He did not seem tired.  With verbals the negatives not and never always precede  them even if they are analytical forms.  e.g. I had learned a long time ago not to show what I felt.  He went on drinking his coffee not saying anythi ng more.  She knew that he had gone never to return.  I have kept him out of your life keep him now out of mine  by never mentioning him again.   171. In addition to the above described features which the  infinitive and the ing -form have in common each of t he two ver - bals possesses peculiarities of its own.  The infinitive is generally preceded by the particle to but. in  certain functions it is used without it and in still other functions  the use of the particle is optional. The use or the absence of the   particle will be considered in connection with each of the func - tions of the infinitive.  Note. The infinitive and the particle to may be separated from each other by  the insertion of an adverb between them such as never ever fully really even.  This is called a split infinitive.  e.g. She was the first person to ever understand me Frank.  Im sorry I made a mistake. It was a mistake to even try to help you.  However split infinitives are very rarely found in English.  If there are two or more infinitiv es in the same function fol - lowing each other the particle to is usually used before the first  one and need not be repeated before the others.  e.g. Amy admired Lilian because she could do a lot of things  she was said for instance to dance and skate v ery well.  Sometimes however the particle to is repeated for emphasis  to make the action of each infinitive more prominent.  e.g. The hero when the heroine hurts his feelings is said to feel  for a moment a wild desire of the caveman the longing to  seize her to drag her with him to give her a good beating.  The infinitive may sometimes be represented by the particle to alone. This happens when the infinitive is easily supplied from the  previous context.  e.g. Joe said I dont think we are going to catc h any fish.  I never expect to said Lizzy.  She would have listened if I had called her attention to it but  I had already decided not to.  Another peculiarity of the infinitive is that it may be used as  part of a phrase introduced by the conjunctive prono uns or ad - verbs what who whom which when where whether how and how long. As most of them begin with wh- this kind of infinitive  group may be called the wh-phrase dablju eic freiz.  e.g- I didnt know what to say.  I couldnt decide whether to spe ak or not.   172. The ing -form in its turn has peculiarities of its own.  unli the infinitive it may in certain functions be preceded by  a preposition.  e.g. For anybody as clever as you are youre not really good at deciding things.  He told me that we were about to be turned out of our flat  for not paying the rent.  The ing-form  has another peculiarity it may lose its verbal  character and become adjectivized. In this case the ing -form be - comes devoid of the idea of action and sometimes its lexical mean - ing is changed as compared with the meaning of the corresponding  verb.  e.g. They found his ideas very upsetting.  His erect rather forbidding figure made him look old -fashi - oned.  In the second example forbidding means    -  it differs from the meaning of the verb to forbid  -  . Adjectivized ing -forms like real adjectives may be preceded  by adverbs of degree such as very rather most quite. how so so ... as etc.  e.g. She is always  so amusing.  The results which he obtained proved to be moat striking.  Note 1. There are a number of ing -forms of this kind that are used only as ad - jectives in present -day English  e.g. interesting charming dashing etc. Note 2. In English there are a considerable number of nouns in -ing. They may  denote concrete things e.g. landing     or abstract notions  including actions e.g. beginning   singing   reading  . These nouns lack the above described properties of the ing -form and like any other  noun may be associated with the article definite  or indefinite with pronouns  such as some any a lot of etc or may be modified by adjectives.  e.g. The drums were silent the singing stopped.  My wife had once a vegetarian bulldog said Mr Smith with pride. Of course.  it took some training.  I adm ired the dancer and asked if she ever did any real Indian dancing.  I do a lot of travelling he said.  She had an attack of violent sobbing.  Nouns in -ing denoting actions are called verbal nouns. They should not be  confused with the ing form proper even when they denote actions e.g. reading  writing walking etc..  The Participle   173. Although the participle has the same lexical meaning as  the corresponding verb it differs considerably from the finite  forms as well as from the infinitive and the ing -form.  As the participle has only one form see Verbs  5 and Ap - pendix it does not possess any of the grammatical categories of  the infinitive and the ing -form. Nevertheless this form has its  own grammatical meaning.  The grammatical meaning of the p articiple is closely connected  with the lexical character of the verb.  The participle is in the main formed from transitive verbs  and has passive meaning.  e.g. He had suits and coats and shirts made to order.  It was a question put down by one of the co rrespondents.  When the participle is formed from transitive terminative  verbs it denotes a state resulting from a previously accomplished  action. This resultant state is simultaneous with the action ex - pressed by the predicate verb.  e.g. On arriving at t he small building on the top of the mountain  she found it locked.  Alfred left alone stood motionless for some minutes.  A participle formed from a transitive durative verb denotes an  action it is simultaneous with the action expressed by the predi - cate verb.  e.g. Tom was the happy husband adoring and adored  At last the Colonel accompanied by his two daughters made  his appearance in the park.  The number of participles formed from intransitive verbs is  very limited. They have active meaning and usuall y denote an ac - tion preceding that of the predicate verb.  e-g. She sat down on a fallen tree to have a short rest.  The house was made of unpainted plank gone grey now.  Sometimes the participle is formed from an intransitive mean - ing of a polysemantic ve rb. e.g.. His face was like a withered apple.  She looked at the faded photograph.   174. Like the finite forms and the other two verbals the  participle is always associated with a subject. But the means of  expressing its subject are more limited than tho se of expressing  the subject of the infinitive and the ing form.  The subject of the participle may be the person or thing denot - ed by the subject a or the object b of the sentence. It may also  be expressed by the noun the participle modifies c.  e.g. a Suddenly touched she came over to the side of her fa- thers chair and kissed him.  b He heard his name called.  c A large fat man with a face shaved as smooth as marble  stood in the doorway.  As the participle is as a rule formed from transitive verbs  and has passive meaning it mostly has a passive subject. But its  active subject the doer of the action may also be indicated in the  sentence with the help of a by-phrase.  e.g. I looked at the ceiling painted by some 18th century artist  now forgotten.   175. The participle can be used only as a notional verb see  the examples above and below it never serves as a structural  word. In this respect it also differs from the finite forms and the  two other verbals.  But like the infinitive and the ing-form the participle is widely  used as second or third component of analytical forms e.g. The  letter is written. He has done it. The matter has been investigated.   176. The syntactic functions of the participle in the sentence  are more restricted than those of the other two verbals. It mainly  performs the functions of the adjective.  e.g. One day he landed in Santa Domingo in torn and dusty clothes.  He stood amazed at the door of the shop.   177. The participle like the other two verbals is in some of  its func tions lexically and structurally dependent. For example  its use is required by the verb to have in the following pattern.  e.g. Youll never guess where I had the suit made.  The functions of the participle will be dealt with in detail below.   178. The pa rticiple like the finite forms and the two other  verbals can be modified by secondary parts of the sentence. But  the number of those modifiers is restricted and the participle  phrase is never very extended. The secondary parts that modify  the participle usually denote the place a or the time b or the  doer of the action c. They always follow the participle.  e.g. a I had my suitcase put in the corner of a third -class carriage.  b She told me of the parcel delivered in the morning.      c They let h im know of the decision taken by the committee.  The negative not is always placed before the participle.  e.g. Margaret not convinced was still arguing about it.  If the verb requires a prepositional object the preposition is  retained by the participle wh en the object happens to be separated  from it.  e.g. He never uttered a word unless spoken to.  The blood in his cut seemed very dark. You ought to have it  looked at I said.  179. The participle often becomes adjectivized. Adjectiviza - tion is even more typical of the participle than of the ing-form.  It becomes devoid of the idea of action and sometimes its lexical  meaning is changed as compared with the meaning of the corre - sponding verb see the second and third examples below - e.g. On the surface my  life was varied and exciting but beneath  it was narrow.  He was an elegant gentleman though given to talking in a  gruff voice       . The streets deserted now looked frightening    -  . The adjectivized partic iple may be preceded like a real adjec - tive by adverbs of degree.  e.g. Is Mrs White really very excited?  Suddenly looking rather alarmed she rushed out of the room.  The road was as deserted as ever.  Note 1. Some participles are used only as adjective s in present -day English  e.g. tired interested accustomed and others.  Note 2. There are a number of adjectives ending in -ed which are homonymous  to participles. They are actually adjectives formed from nouns e.g. stockinged  legs propertied classes a  bearded face a gifted person a talented musician etc. Adjectives built up on this pattern mean having stockings having property  having a beard etc.   180. The use of all the three verbals is characterized by one  more peculiarity the frequency of their occurrence varies greatly  in different functions. In some functions their use is extensive in  other functions it is infrequent. At the same time some of their  functions are found only in literary style.  In describing the various functions of the ve rbals special  mention will be made of their frequency of occurrence and stylis - tic restrictions.  The Use of the Infinitive  The Infinitive as Subject   181. In this function the infinitive is always used with the  particle to and usually expresses an actio n following the action  denoted by the predicate verb.  e.g. To fulfil this condition was hopelessly out of my power.  To visit her was all that I desired.  The infinitive as subject may also express actions which are si - multaneous with the action of the pred icate verb  e.g. To visit her is always a pleasure.  The infinitive often acquires the additional modal meaning of  condition in this function. This meaning is generally supported by  the use of the Conditional Mood in the sentence  e.g. To take money from hi m would be like robbing a child if you took money from him....  To take him seriously would be absurd  if you took him se - riously... - For the  means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the infinitive see Verbs  166.  Sentences with the infinitive as subject have certain structural  peculiarities  a The infinitive as subject may be used only in declarative sen - tences it is never used in interrogative sentences.  b The infinitive is always placed at the head of the sentence it  is never pr eceded by any secondary parts.  c We generally find the nominal predicate in sentences of this  kind. The predicative is usually expressed by a noun or an adjec - tive qualifying the action denoted by the infinitive.  e.g. To go with him to picture galleries wa s a rare treat.  To do it seemed a proper and natural thing.  Not to go back was awful.  Sometimes another infinitive is used as predicative  e.g. To influence a person is to give him ones thoughts.  The use of the infinitive as subject is mainly found in lit erary  English but even there it is infrequent.  For comparison with the ing -form see  209 and 235.  The Infinitive as Predicative   182. The infinitive is generally preceded by the particle to in this function and in most cases expresses an action which follows  that of the link -verb.  The link -verb in sentences with the infinitive as predicative is  always to be.  e.g. His highest ambition was to write a monumental work on art.  The job of a reporter is to expose and record.  His greatest wish was to tell her everything.  The only sensible thing is for you to go away.  The infinitive in this function always has appositive meaning  i.e- it explains the meaning of the subject of the sentence. Hence  sentences of this kind have the following structural peculiarity  the subject of the sentence can be expressed only by a limited  number of nouns. They are nouns denoting abstract notions which  admit of and sometimes even require an explanation of their  meaning. The most commonly occurring of these nouns are act actio n advice aim ambition answer business consequence cus - tom desire difficulty duty function habit hope idea instruc - tion intention job method need object aim order plan poli  cy problem purpose reason requirement role rule t ask thing  usually with an attribute thought way wish work and some  others see the examples above.  The subject of the sentence may also be expressed by all and occasionally by the least and the most modified by an attributive  clause which usually  contains the verb to do.  e.g. All I want to do is to help you.  The least we can do is to try and understand their idea.  The most he could do at the moment was to give me a cigarette.  After this type of subject the infinitive may be used without to. e.g. All I wanted to do was run away.  All we can do is stick to our decision.  Sentences with the subject expressed by all the least and the most cannot be used in the interrogative form.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the infin itive see Verbs  166.  The infinitive as predicative unlike the infinitive as subject  is found not only in literary style but also in spoken English.  For comparison with the ing-form  see  210 and 236.  The Infinitive as Predicate   183. The use of  the infinitive as predicate is restricted to the  following sentence patterns  1 Interrogative affirmative and negative sentences begin  ning with why and implying a suggestion. We always find an in- finitive without to here.  In interrogative -affirmativ e sentences the implication is that  there is no need to perform the action  e.g. Why lose your temper over a little thing like that?  Why waste your time on this kind of work?  In interrogative -negative sentences the implication is that  there is nothing to prevent one from performing the action.  e.g. Why not go there right away?  Why not apologize if you know youre wrong?  The subject of the infinitive in this kind of sentences is always  the person or the persons engaged in the conversation.  2 Exclamatory sentences showing that the person denoted by  the subject is unlikely to perform the action of the infinitive  the speaker rejects the idea as impossible. The infinitive may be  used with or without to. e.g. You   a man -of-the-world   to suggest this! You k now its  impossible.  Try to write she said youre expressive you can say what  you want why not try to be a writer? I couldnt keep  from laughing at that. It was so absurd. Me   write! No  I said with a laugh.  Such sentences are emotionally colour ed and found only in  spoken English but they are infrequent.  For comparison with the ing -form see  211.  The Infinitive as Part of a Compound  Verbal Predicate   184. The infinitive is lexically dependent in this function  it is used only after certain verbs a after modal verbs this use  has been described in detail in Verbs  76 -120 and b after the  following intransitive verbs to seem to appear to turn out to  Prove to happen to chance.  e-g- He seemed to know all about it.  Im quite aware ho w improbable that sounds but it happens  to be the truth.  He turned out to have no feeling whatsoever for his nephew.  These verbs may be followed by different analytical forms of  the infinitive with to. e.g. For a moment she appeared to be hesitating.  He se emed to have gained all he wanted.  The letter seems to have been mislaid.  In that same week I happened to have been enquiring whether  all the invitations had been sent out.  As is seen from the above examples the Perfect infinitive ex - presses an action w hich precedes the action indicated by the finite  verb while the Continuous infinitive expresses an action simulta - neous with it.  The subject of the infinitive in this function is the same as the  subject of the sentence see the examples above. For comp arison  with the ing -form see  212.  The Infinitive as a Second Action Accompanying the Action  of the Predicate Verb   185. The infinitive may express a second action in the sen - tence accompanying the action of the predicate verb. The subject  of the infi nitive is the same as that of the predicate verb. This sec - ond action follows the action expressed by the predicate verb and  may be called a subsequent action. Hence the term the infinitive of  subsequent action.  The infinitive of subsequent action always follows the predicate  and is used with the particle to.  The most commonly occurring verbs followed by this kind of  infinitive are those of motion such as to come to hurry to reach  to return to run to rush to turn to walk and their synonyms as  well a s the verbs to look or to glance followed by up down  across about round toward etc. to wake up to awake to be  awakened.  The infinitive of subsequent action itself may also be ex - pressed by a wide range of verbs of different lexical character  but by far the most frequently occurring verbs are to discover to  find to hear to see and their synonyms.  e.g. He turned to find her sad calm eyes upon him.  and found  He returned ten minutes later to find Bridget ready for de - parture.  and found  I looked across to see Mr Jesmond smiling at me.  and saw  One night he awakened to hear a light rain whispering in the  garden.  and heard    Then the sun came out again to brighten the last spatter of  rain. and brightened  As a rule the action o f the infinitive instantly follows that of  the predicate verb as in all the examples above. Sometimes how - ever this immediate succession of actions is expressed in the sen - tence by means of special indications such as in time or just in  time the ne xt moment and the like.  e.g. Alice arrived in time to hear Toms remark.  Etta then shot out of the room just in time to shut the door  behind her before she exploded into incontrollable shrieks  of laughter.  If the action of the infinitive does not follow th at of the predicate  verb directly there are usually special indications of time in  he sentence.  e.g. I know of quite a few people who always start a new life on  the 1st of January only to slip back to the old one on the  15th.  He walked out one morning wit hout a word to anyone to be  heard of some time afterwards in Australia.  The infinitive of subsequent action is sometimes preceded by  only. In this case the combination of the predicate verb and the  infinitive usually acquires the following meaning the ac tion of  the predicate verb becomes pointless and its effect is as it were  brought to naught by the action expressed by the infinitive.  e.g. The motor started again only to stop again in a moment.  He took off the receiver only to replace it.  The infiniti ve of subsequent action may be preceded by never to show that the action of the infinitive is not destined to take place.  e-g. She knew that he had gone never to return.  Young Hardcastle when he attained the age of fifteen had  disappeared from his home never to be heard of again.  The infinitive of subsequent action is not in common use in  English it is mainly restricted to literary style.  For comparison with the ing -form see  213.   The Infinitive as Object   186. The infinitive may be used as an objec t of a verb. It is  lexically dependent in this function. We find it after the following  verbs to agree to arrange to ask to request to attempt to be - gin to care to like to cease to choose to prefer to claim  to come to begin to conse nt to continue to decide to deserve  to determine to expect to fail to fear to forget to go on to  hate to help to hesitate to hope to intend to learn to like to  long to love to manage to mean to need to neglect to offer to  omit to p lan to prefer to pretend to promise to propose to in - tend to refuse to regret to remember to start to swear to  tend to threaten to try to want to wish and some others.  e.g. They had arranged to visit the laboratory the next day.  Margaret continued to visit Jack in hospital.  I came to know him well towards the end of the war.  Do you mean to say he actually approves of it?  He did not propose to forgive this time.  He did not want to be left alone.  I pretended not to be listening.  She claims to have read his diary.  In addition to the verbs mentioned above the infinitive as an  object is used after the modal phrases can afford and can bear in their negative and interrogative forms  e.g. Some say we cannot afford to do it. I say we cannot afford  not to do it. Can you afford to go on such an expensive trip?  I couldnt bear to damage him.  The infinitive is also used after the set phrases to make up  ones mind to take care to take the trouble to make sure and some others.  e.g. I took care to ask Strickland nothing about his own doings.  The next day he made sure to buy a copy of the newspaper.  With all the verbs mentioned above the infinitive is used with  the particle to see the examples above. The only exception is the  verb to help which may be  followed by an infinitive with or with  out to. e.g. Helen will help to make tea.  Im sure you will help talk her out of it.  The subject of the infinitive in this function is the same as  that of the predicate verb see the examples above.  For comparison  with the ing-form  see  214 and 237.   187. The infinitive may also be used as an object of an adjec - tive. It is lexically dependent in this case. It is used after various  kinds of adjectives adjectives proper predicative adjectives and  adjectivized  participles. The most commonly occurring of them  are unable afraid aghast amused annoyed anxious apt  ashamed astonished bound careful certain content crazy curi - ous delighted determined difficult disposed distressed due ea - ger e asy entitled fit fortunate free frightened furious glad  grateful good happy hard helpless horrified impatient inclined  interested keen liable unlikely lucky moved obliged pleased  impossible powerless prepared proud puzzled quick ready re - lieved reluctant resolved right safe scared set  determined  slow sorry sufficient sure surprised thankful touched useless  unwilling unwise wonderful worthy wrong etc. e.g. Hes still very anxious to see you.  I am curious to know the news.  He would be crazy not to do so. I felt reluctant to go out. His next book is sure to be worthless.  Dinner was ready to be served.  The subject is now not likely to be raised during the talks.  I am sorry to have done you harm.  The infinitive is always preceded by to in this function.  Adjectives having infinitives as objects are generally used in  the function of a predicative after the link -verb to be see the ex - amples above. Other link -verbs are also possible though they are  infrequent.  e.g.- He seemed glad to have me there.  I found them getting ready to go out.  In a vast majority of cases the subject of the infinitive is the  person or thing denoted by the subject of the sentence see the ex - amples above. However when the in finitive follows the adjec - tives difficult easy good hard wonderful the subject of the sen - tence becomes the object of the action expressed by the infinitive.  e.g. Their language was not difficult to understand.  She was not easy to discourage.  I was  angry because he was so hard to persuade.  The apples were good to eat.  Occasionally a for -phrase is used to indicate the subject of the  infinitive  e.g. He was impatient for me to meet them.  He was eager for me to start on my new job.  I am prepared for ev eryone to accuse me of being foolish.  For comparison with the ing-form  see  215 217 and 238.   188. The infinitive as object may be part of a phrase intro - duced by the conjunction whether or one of the following conjunc - tive pronouns or adverbs what who whom which when where  how and how long.  e.g. I did not at all know what to say. I dont know who else to ask.  Neither of us knew when to begin.  He had come away not knowing where to turn or what to do.  As most of the conjunctive words begin w ith wh- this kind of  infinitive group may be called the wh -phrase. The infinitive in the  phrase is always preceded by to. As is seen from the above examples the wh -phrase serves as  an object of a verb. It usually occurs after the verb to know see the ex amples above. Yet it may also follow some other verbs and  set phrases e.g. to advise to decide to make up ones mind to wonder and some others.  e.g. He could not decide whether to speak or not.  I couldnt make up my mind whether to accept the offer.  I stood wondering how to stop the fight.  Ill ask my travel agent. He advises me what to buy and where to go. As is known infinitives generally do not serve as prepo - sitional objects. However the wh-phrase is occasionally found as  a prepositional object  of a verb or a set phrase.  e.g. As we talked of where to meet I noticed something unusual  in his tone.  Whether he had changed his mind about what to say I did not know.  She gave us orders about how long to stay there.  In most cases the subject of the inf initive in this function is  the same as that of the predicate verb occasionally it is expressed  by some secondary part of the sentence see the examples above.  Although the wh-phrase is not in frequent use it is not re - stricted stylistically.  Note. The wh-phrase may in theory have all the functions of the infinitive in  the sentence. But actually it mainly occurs as an object to the verb to know. Here  however are some examples of the wh -phrase in other functions  e.g. a as an object to an adjective  No one seemed sure how to act.  b as a predicative The main problem is of course where to go.  c as an attribute I dont remember that I ever received any instruction on  how to put sentences together.   189. The infinitive may serve as object in a special s entence  pattern with a formal it as subject. It is lexically dependent here  as it follows quite definite verbs.  The most commonly occurring verbs after which the infinitive  is used in this function are to amaze to annoy to cause to com - fort to deligh t to distress to enrage to excite to frighten to  hurt to interest to irritate to mean to occur to please to puz - zle to shock to soothe to startle to stir to surprise to trouble  to upset to worry and some others.  The verbs in this senten ce pattern are usually followed by  some other objects direct indirect or prepositional which pre - cede the infinitive.  e-g. In those days my experience of life at first hand was small  and it excited me to come upon an incident.  It did not annoy him to live always in the same shabby room.  It pleased her particularly to see how often the other chil - dren asked her son how they should play.  It never occurred to him to pretend that he had no influence  on events.  Besides there are a number of set phrases w hich are in com  mon use and are treated as verb equivalents. They are all differ - ent in structure and in meaning. But since they have the function  of the predicate in the sentence they are best to be classed as verb  equivalents and treated here.  e.g. It d oes me good to watch her playing with the other children.  It couldnt do any harm to take her out of town.  It will take a long time to talk over the whole of it with you.  It took several days for her to fully realize it. A porters voice informed them that  it was time to board the train.  One morning it was his turn to cook breakfast.  Mr Brooke said it was up to the girl to decide whether or not  to accept the invitation.  The infinitive is always preceded by to in this function.  The subject of the infinitive in most cases is the person denot - ed by the noun or pronoun object following the verb.  e.g. It would interest him to hear about it.  It didnt occur to me to ask him about it.  For comparison with the ing-form  see  218 and 239.   190. In a sentence p attern with it as a formal subject the in - finitive with the particle to as object is also found after a con - siderable number of adjectives adjectivized participles and ing- forms. The most commonly occurring of them are absurd advisable.  amazing a stonishing awful awkward bad careless characteristic  charming complicated convenient correct cruel curious custom - ary dangerous decent delightful desirable difficult dull easy  embarrassing enough essential fair fine foolish funny  futile  good hard helpful dishonourable horrid important insulting  interesting intolerable jolly unjust kind late marvellous - monstrous naive unnatural unnecessary nice normal odd - pleasant impossible preposterous proper qu eer unreasonable  remarkable ridiculous right sad safe satisfying sensible shock  ing silly splendid strange stupid sufficient suitable surprising  sweet terrible typical unbearable useful useless vital wicked  unwise wonderful w rong etc. e.g. Its a little late to admit it I know.  It was surprising to hear how strong his voice sounded.  Its stupid to fall asleep like this it gives you a headache.  Its wrong to hurt people.  It was unwise to be rude to David.  Its unusual to mee t a shy girl nowadays.  Its important to remember the figures.  Note. It should be mentioned that it is worth while is normally followed by an  infinitive object whereas it is worth is modified by an ing-form object see Verbs  219.  e.g. It might be wort h while to mention that there is a train soon after 5. Do you think it would be worth while to open a shop somewhere else in the  neighbourhood?  The subject of the infinitive in this sentence pattern is usually  associated with every or any person or an inde finite number of  unidentified persons see the examples above. Yet it is not un - usual for the infinitive object in this sentence pattern to have a  subject of its own. In this case the infinitive far -phrase is used.  e.g. It was rare for him to go out to dinner.  Its very good for them to have an older man with plenty of  experience to come to for advice.  Of course said Mont its natural for young men to be in- terested in politics.  It was necessary for her to earn her living as quickly as she  could.  The peculiar feature of this sentence pattern is that the infini - tive and its subject can be introduced by the preposition of. e.g. Its kind of you to come she said.  It was inconsiderate of her to ask that.  He thought it was wrong of him to go off forever and leave  his mother all on her own.  For comparison with the ing-form  see  219 and 239.   191. The infinitive as object of an adjective is sometimes  found in a sentence pattern with it as a formal object of some  verbs. They are commonly the verbs  to feel to find to make and to think.  e.g. I find it difficult to believe that anyone can be that lazy.  Yet I found it necessary to tell him that I had been in touch  with Mont.  I had thought it impolite to smoke a cigar in her presence.  He felt it natur al to accept hospitality.  His anger made it impossible for us to continue the conversation.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the infinitive see Verbs  166. For comparison with the ing form see 219 and 220.  The Infini tive as Subjective Predicative   192. The infinitive as subjective predicative is always preced  ed by to. It is lexically dependent   it follows a number of transi - tive verbs used in the passive. The most frequently occurring of  these verbs are to advise  to allow to ask to authorize to be  lieve to command to compel to consider to direct to expect to  feel to find to force to hear to impel to instruct to intend  to invite to know to leave to let to make to mean to order  to permit to persuade to presume to report to request to re  quire to rumour to say to schedule to see to sentence to show  to suppose to teach to tell to tempt to think to trust to under  stand to watch and some others.  e.g. I have been advised to rest.  He had been heard to discuss the possibility.  I believe they have been instructed to report to you by October.  Douglas was invited to have a drink with a Cabinet Minister.  No doubt no one could be persuaded to give her a job.  The public are requested not to walk on the grass.  He is said to be a good chap.  Note. When the verb to know is used in the Passive and is followed by an in  finitive it may have two meanings   to be aware and to experience. In the  former case the verb to know is found only in the Present or Past Indefinite and is  followed by the infinitive to be.  e.g. You are known to be a preposterously unselfish friend.  Mr Dinis who was known to be interested in the case made it clear that he  would proceed with it.  In the latter case the verb to know is found only in the Present and Past Per - fect and can be followed by other infinitives as well.  e.g. He has been known to drop a hint.  Hes been known to take part in the work of different committees.  In the function of subjective predicative the  infinitive is often  used in its different analytical forms.  e.g. He was believed to be preparing a report on the incident.  Some professors are known to have disagreed with the au - thorities on students demands.  The new system is intended to be applied in a month.  The victim is believed to have been poisoned.  For comparison with the ing-form see  221 and 240.  The Infinitive as Objective Predicative   193. The infinitive as objective predicative is lexically depen - dent  it is used after a number of tr ansitive verbs in the active  followed by an object which is expressed by a noun or a pronoun.  Most of these verbs require an infinitive with to. The most fre - quently occurring of them are to advise to allow to ask to as - sume to authorize to beg to  believe to cause to challenge to  command to compel to consider to enable to encourage to ex  pect to find to forbid to force to get to guess to hate to imag - ine to impel to implore to induce to inspire to instruct to in - tend to invi te to know to lead to like to love to mean to  observe to order to permit to persuade to prefer to press to re - alize to recommend to request to require to suppose to suspect  to take  to understand to teach to tell to tempt to think  to trust to understand to urge to want to warn to wish and some  others.  e-g. Why did he advise me to visit Westminster Abbey?  I must ask you to ring him up tonight.  Youve encouraged people to believe that.  We cant force you to stay here.  Why don t you get my wife to explain it to you?  He ordered the door to be thrown open.  Did he urge you to reconsider your decision?  Note that after verbs expressing opinion or perception by far  the most common infinitive is the verb to be which is a link -verb  in this case.  e.g. No one could expect her to be happy.  I hope youll find the new method to be of considerable inter - est. I never took him to be a Norwegian.  I always believed him to be a brute.  He didnt mean this to be a long meeting.  There are a few verbs  in English after which the infinitive as  objective predicative is used without the particle to. They are to feel to have to get to make to hear to know to experience  to let to make to notice to see to watch.  e.g. I felt Margarets hand tighten in mine.  I had not heard him speak before and now I realized that he  was a good speaker.  What makes you think you have any talent?  In the library I noticed Diana talk for a moment with her sis - ter alone.  She struggled for self -control and I saw her  hands clench  and unclench spasmodically.  Ive watched you grow for many years from when you were  a little baby.  She was not quite so naive as she would have had me think.  Note. The verb to know in the meaning to be aware is generally used in the  Presen t or Past Indefinite and followed only by the infinitive to be with the par - ticle to. e.g. We all know it to be impossible.  I knew that to be true.  In the meaning to experience the verb to know is generally used in the  Present or Past Perfect and may be  followed by the infinitive of any verb. The in  finitive is used without to in this case.  e.g. She is worried Ive never known her lose her nerve before.  1 had never known Hector behave like this.  The infinitive after the verb to help may be used with or  with - out the particle to. e.g. He said he would have helped me move in.  I was helping him to win as thoroughly as if my happiness  were at stake.  Note. To let somebody know is a set phrase  e.g. Why didnt you let me know you were coining?  The subject of the infinitive in the function of objective pred - icative is the noun or pronoun which serves as the object to the  predicate verb see the examples above. There are instances when  the object of the predicate verb is a reflexive pronoun. Then it in - dicate s that the subject of the infinitive is the same person or  thing as denoted by the subject of the sentence.  e.g. Roger had made himself seem friendly again.  Note. Note the set phrases cant bring oneself to do something and to set one - self to do something  which always require reflexive pronouns as objects.  e.g. But I still cant bring myself to feel the way he does about things.  I had set myself to tell the absolute truth.   194. The infinitive as objective predicative is also used after  a few verbs taking  a prepositional object. The most regularly oc - curring of them are to appeal to to call upon to listen to to  long for to look for to nod to to rely on to wait for to watch  for. After these verbs the infinitive is used with to except for the  verb to listen to which takes an infinitive without to. e.g. He was looking for someone to help him.  But later Id lie awake watching for the light to come  through the little window.  Her whole life had been spent listening to other people talk.  He nodded to t he mechanics to remove the block.  They appealed to him to give up the idea.  They were waiting for dinner to be announced.  Occasionally the infinitive as objective predicative may be  found after a few verbs which do not regularly require preposition - al objects. Here belong for example such verbs as to arrange to  ask to beckon to cry to manage to plan to provide to shout to  sign to telegraph to wire and some others. The most commonly used  preposition is for but occasionally we may also find with or to. e.g. Then she looked at me and beckoned for me to come over.  By the way I must arrange for you to meet the old man some  time.  I arranged with the concierge to make my coffee in the morn - ing and keep the place clean.  I know that she telegraphed to Julia to come and bring me  with her.  They drove up to the verandah steps and shouted to me to  come down.  The subject of the infinitive is always the person or thing de - noted by the prepositional object see the examples above.  For comparison with the  ing-form  see  222 and 241.  The Infinitive as Adverbial Modifier   195. The infinitive may serve as an adverbial modifier of a  verb. In this function it is used to express purpose consequence  comparison condition and exception.  For the means of expr essing the subject of the action denoted  by the infinitive see Verbs  166.   196. The infinitive as adverbial modifier of purpose is al - ways used with the particle to. The number of verbs followed by an infinitive of purpose is not  restricted and thei r lexical character may be quite different. But  they are all alike in one respect   they all express actions deliber - ately carried out with a definite aim in view. In other words these  actions are aimed at the realization of the action denoted by the  infinitive. The action of the infinitive follows that of the predi - cate verb and is unaccomplished as yet.  e.g. I dressed and went out to buy the morning paper.  I came in to see if I could help you pack Alison.  I did my best to stop her.  He put his head out  of the window to get some fresh air.  The infinitive of purpose may occasionally be preceded by the  modifiers in order and so as which emphasize the idea of purpose.  e.g. I was silent for a moment in order to give greater force to  my next remark.  Next we slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen  up and cool off.  So as is quite common with a negative infinitive of purpose  however.  e.g. We had gone into the middle of Hyde Park so as not to be  overheard.  She hurried so as not to give him time for reflexion.  The infinitive may also be preceded by other modifiers. Unlike  in order and so as which only make the idea of purpose more  prominent the other modifiers serve to add their own specific  shades of meaning.  e.g. He opened his mouth wide as if to speak.  Christine smiled mockingly and turned away as though to  go out of the room.  He gave me a little smile as much as to say You see I  dont mean any harm.  He had never cared for that room hardly going into it from  one years end to another except  to take cigars.  They were waiting in there just to see him.  He told his joke merely to gain time.  The infinitive of purpose generally follows the predicate verb  see the examples above. But if special stress is laid on the infini - tive of purpose it may  be placed at the head of the sentence. How - ever it is not often found in this position  e.g. To relieve my feelings I wrote a letter to Robert.  I forgive you. To prove it Ill drop in at your lab some time.  Occasionally the infinitive of purpose is plac ed between the  subject and the predicate.  e.g. Ann to pass the time had left her kitchen to see whether  Mr Faber was all right.   197- The infinitive as adverbial modifier of consequence is  used with the particle to. It is structurally dependent   we fi nd it in a peculiar sentence pattern the first part of which is he had only to... or he had but to... . e.g. I had only to look at Mother to know the answer.  He had only to open the door to find them anxiously waiting  for him.  Here was romance and it s eemed that you had but to stretch  out your hand to touch it. In this sentence pattern the action of the infinitive is the con - sequence of the action expressed by the predicate verb   it is suf - ficient to perform the first action for the second action to follow.  A similar pattern in Russian usually begins with    ...  The use of the infinitive of consequence is infrequent.   198. The infinitive as adverbial modifier of comparison is also structurally dependent. It is preceded by than and modifies a  predicate group containing the comparative degree of an adjective  or adverb. The infinitive is generally used with the particle to though sometimes it may be found without it.  e.g. She seemed more anxious to listen to the troubles of others  than to discuss her own.  I should have known better than to expect to find it.  Damn it Ive got more important things to do than look at the sea.  This function is not of frequent occurrence.   199. The infinitive with to may serve as an adverbial modi - fier of condition. In this case it expresses a condition under whic h the action of the predicate verb can be realized. The predicate  verb is as a rule used in the form of the Conditional Mood.  e.g. To hear him talk you would think he was a celebrity.  He is a popular singer Monica said. You wouldnt believe  it to look at him remarked Teddy.  The infinitive in this function is not frequent either.   200. The infinitive as adverbial modifier of exception denotes  the only possible action that can be performed under the circum - stances. The use of this infinitive is s tructurally dependent   it is preceded by except or but and is generally used in negative or in - terrogative sentences after nothing could be done... he could do  nothing... what could he do... he could not help... and the like.  The infinitive is as a  rule used without to. e.g. We care for each other and there is nothing to be done about  it except tell you the truth.  There was nothing to do but escape.  At nineteen minutes to six   I could not help but watch the clock   the telephone buzzed.  What coul d he do but smile?  The use of the particle to is an exception.  e.g. Daniel held out his arm to her. She had no choice but to obey.  The infinitive of exception is infrequent.   201. The infinitive may also serve as adverbial modifier of  an adjective. In thi s case it is always an adverbial modifier of  consequence. The infinitive here has the particle to. The infinitive of consequence is not lexically dependent   it can modify any adjective. But it is dependent structurally as it  can be used only in the follow ing cases  1 With adjectives modified by enough which are as a rule  predicatives in the sentence.  e.g. He was old enough to be her father.  I cant think whod be stupid enough to side with you.  I hope hes sensible enough to agree to their proposal.  I had known him as a doctor but was not old enough to have  known him as a friend.  I was young enough for the children not to feel shy and they  chattered merrily about one thing and another.  As is seen from the above examples the action of the in - finitive is made possible owing to the sufficient degree of the  Quality expressed by the adjective.  Note. The infinitive can also serve as an adverbial modifier of consequence of  an adverb modified by enough.  e.g. I wish I knew him well enough to judge.  2 With ad jectives in the sentence pattern containing the cor - relative conjunction so ... as. e.g. He was so fortunate as to escape.  If you are so stupid as to lend him your car you must expect  it to be damaged.  It should be noted that sentences of the following ki nd have be - come polite formulas to express requests  e.g. Would you be so good as to answer the telephone if it rings?  Would you be so kind as to send us your catalogues?  The infinitive in the sentence pattern with the correlative con - junction so ... as is not of frequent occurrence.  3 With adjectives preceded by too. The adjectives are generally  predicatives in the sentence  e.g. Everyone seemed to be talking but I was too shy to take part  in the conversation.  Youre too young to start giving up your p lans.  She told me she was too tired to go out.  He was too embarrassed for us to ask him about anything.  The action of the infinitive is made impossible owing to the  excessive degree of the quality expressed by the adjective.  Note. The infinitive can also s erve as an adverbial modifier of consequence of  an adverb preceded by too. e.g. He liked her too much to cause her any trouble.  For comparison with the ing -form see  223 -225.   202. The subject of the infinitive in all the above described  adverbial fun ctions is the same person or thing as denoted by the  subject of the sentence see the examples above. But the infinitive  may also have a subject of its own with which it forms the so - called absolute construction.  The absolute construction with the infini tive is introduced by  the preposition with. The infinitive is used with the particle to.  The absolute construction has the function of adverbial modi - fier of attending circumstances in the sentence.  e.g. It was a quiet house now with only his secretary to see to  his meals and to take care of his business affairs.  Miss Heythorp is below Sir with a carriage to take you home.  As is seen from the above examples there are two parallel ac - tions in this sentence pattern one of them is expressed by the  predicate verb the other by the infinitive. Each action has its own  subject.  The infinitive absolute construction is infrequent and found  only in literary style.  For comparison with the ing-form  see  226.  The Infinitive as Attribute   203. The infinitive in the function of attribute immediately  follows its head -noun and is used with the particle to. e.g. There is only one way to do it.  You are just the man to do it.  He gave her permission to leave.  Have you any complaint to make against her?  He was touched  by the mans desire to help him.  Whether you want to do that or not is a matter for you to  decide.  Note 1. The infinitive to come undergoes change of meaning   it means  -   . e.g. He looked happy as if he were dreaming of pleasures to come.  She did not realize it for months to come.   Note 2. If the infinitive is placed before a noun it is part of a combination  which tends to become a set phrase. The number of such phrases is limited e.g.  what-to-do advice this never -to-be-forgotten day a much -to-be-longed -for place an  ever-to-be remembered occasion and the like.  Although the infinitive mainly serves as an attribute of nouns  proper it is also free ly used with certain noun equivalents. Thus it  is typical of the infinitive to modify the indefinite pronouns some - body nobody anybody everybody someone no one anyone every - one something nothing anything everything as well as the in - terrogati ve pronouns what and who.   e.g. Have you got anything to eat? Katherine asked - The sergeant said they had nothing to do there.  Its been wonderful having someone to help.  I havent finished yet. What is there to finish?  The infinitive is also freely combined with ordinal numerals  mainly with the first and the substantivized adjective the last  which always have the function of the predicative in the sentence  e.g. He was always the first to enter the dining -room and the last  to leave.  Andrew was the third to be interviewed.  The infinitive also serves as an attribute to nouns which are  preceded by ordinal numerals or the adjective last. e.g. He was the first man ever to discuss the philosophy of sci - ence with Erik.  The film star Ann Wilson is the 34th  actress to play this  part on the London stage.  Dear Steve your last letter to reach me was two months old.  The infinitive may also serve as an attribute of pronouns and  pronominal expressions of quantity such as much little enough  no more little more  a great deal a lot plenty etc. e.g. Ive got a lot to be thankful for.  I thought you had quite enough to do looking after the house  and so forth.  You are leaving me very little to say. Youve got so much to learn.  Occasionally the infinitive is used t o modify the prop -word one. e.g. If you boys want to go on Im not the one to spoil the game.  He wasnt an easy one to make friends with.   204. The infinitive in the function of attribute is char - acterized by specific meanings. They are determined by t he rela - tion between the head -word and the infinitive. These relations may  be of two kinds  1 The head -word may be either the subject or the object of the action expressed by the infinitive. When the head -word serves  as the subject of the infinitive it may be either active or passive  depending on the active a or passive b form of the infinitive.  e.g. a He was not the man to draw back when his dignity was  concerned.  She pitied the poor young man for having no one to look  after him.  b Remember Roge r is a man to be watched.  There is nothing to be gained by pretending.  The head -word of an active infinitive may also be an object of  the action expressed by this infinitive.  e.g. Love? Its a funny word to use.  Except in little things he was the hardest man to influence.  There was really nothing to fear.  In all the above examples we find the infinitive of verbs re - quiring a direct object. If a verb requires a prepositional object  the preposition follows the verb.  e.g. Im not a very easy man to get on w ith. I had nothing to worry about.  He realized that he didnt know anyone here to talk to except  Max.  If the infinitive is a link -verb followed by an adjective which  requires a prepositional object the preposition is placed after the  adjective.  e.g. We ha ve all of us here a good deal to be thankful for  Im sure you have nothing to be afraid of.  Im afraid I havent much to be proud of.  If the head -word is the subject active or passive or the object  of the action denoted by the infinitive the latter a cquires modal  meaning. Depending on the context it may denote either possibil - ity a or necessity b.  e-g. a Marion was not the type to put on weight.  He was not the man to do rash things.  There was nothing to be seen or heard not even a barking  dog. I had nobody to talk to.  Is there a place to get something to eat near here?  b Whenever there is any packing to be done my wife doesnt  feel well.  Ive got something dreadful to tell you. There was a quarter of an hour to kill so we walked down  the ri ver. There is always a question or two to be considered.  Ive got enough to do without bothering about you.  Note that the infinitive is not lexically dependent here. It can  modify practically any noun concrete or abstract as well as noun  equivalents see  the examples above.  Note. There is however one exception to the rule   the ordinal numerals and  the last or nouns modified by them always serve as the subject of the infinitive  but the infinitive does not acquire the additional modal meanings of poss ibility or  necessity in this case.  e.g. He was the first to speak.  2 The head -noun may be neither the subject nor the object of  the action expressed by the infinitive as attribute. In this case it  acquires appositive meaning i.e. it serves to explain the  meaning  of its head -noun. That is why it can modify only those abstract  nouns that admit of or sometimes even require an explanation of  their meaning. So the use of the infinitive with appositive mean - ing is lexically dependent.  The number of nouns with which it is used is quite conside - rable. The most commonly occurring of them are ability advice  attempt authority  right capacity chance command compul  sion decision demand desire determination duty eagerness ef - fort excuse failure f reedom impulse inclination instruction  intention invitation keenness license longing matter motion   proposal necessity need obligation occasion offer opportuni  ty option order patience permission possibility power  right  precau tion promise proposal readiness recommendation refusal  reluctance resistance resolution right sign suggestion tempta  tion tendency urge way will willingness wish and some others.  e.g. He had a keen desire to learn.  He had an impulse to ru n away.  He made an effort to collect himself.  He accepted willingly my invitation to remain for a few days  in my apartment.  Hes given me permission to talk to you myself.  Youve no right to ask those questions.  Her eyes had a tendency to shift from point  to point about  the room.  He bit back the urge to tell a lie.  Ralph was glad of a chance to change the subject.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the infinitive see Verbs  166. For comparison with the ing- iorm see  22 7-230 242.   205. When the head -noun is neither the subject nor the ob - ject of the action expressed by the infinitive in the attributive  function the latter may acquire the meaning of consequence.  This is found in certain sentence patterns or when the head -noun  has special modifiers.  1 In the sentence pattern have get possess lack  the  noun  infinitive.  e.g. He had the courage to tell them what he thought of them.  She had the nerve to tell me a lie!  The action of the infinitive is made possi ble owing to the qual - ity expressed by the head -noun.  The infinitive is lexically dependent in this sentence pattern  it modifies a number of nouns that denote mental or moral quali - ties. The most commonly occurring of them are assurance audac - ity a uthority cheek courage cruelty decency energy experi  ence foolishness good bad taste guts heart  courage  humility ignorance imagination impertinence ingenuity intelli - gence knowledge nerve patience power presence of mind sense  spirit strength stupidity tolerance vanity willingness will pow - er wits and some others.  e.g. They had the cheek to run away.  Why havent you got the wit to invent something?  She lacks the knowledge to do it the way it should be done.  I cant thi nk how you can have the impertinence to remain here.  She possessed the will power to achieve her aim.  The subject of the infinitive in this function is the same as  that of the predicate verb.  2 When the infinitive serves as an attribute of a noun modi - fied by enough. The noun can have different functions in the sen - tence. The infinitive is not lexically dependent here.  e.g. There wasnt enough air to stir the leaves of the lime trees.  He isnt fool enough to believe that sort of thing.  We need every man  who has got enough spirit to say what he  really thinks.  I noticed her curious trick of throwing questions at me when I  could not have enough knowledge to answer.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the infinitive see Verbs  166.  3 When the inifinitive serves as an attribute of a noun pred - icative modified by an adjective that is preceded by too. The infin - itive is not lexically dependent here. For the place of the article  see Articles  66.  e.g. He was too clever a man to be bluffed.  This is too serious a business to be trifled with.  The action of the infinitive is made impossible owing to the  excessive degree of the quality expressed by the adjective that  modifies the head -noun.  For the means of expressing the subje ct of the action denoted  by the infinitive see Verbs  166.  4 In a sentence pattern where we find the correlative conjunc - tion such ... as. e.g. He cant have been such a fool as to give them a definite an - swer right away.  The use of the infinitive o f consequence in the last three sen - tence patterns is not of frequent occurrence.   206. The infinitive may be used as attribute in a special sen - tence pattern with a formal it as subject. The infinitive is lexical - ly dependent here   it can modify a mo re or less limited number  of nouns. Among them we find such se -mantically pale nouns as  action business experience idea matter problem question stuff  task thing way. As a rule these nouns are modified by adjectives  which are semantically more important than the nouns them - selves. The most frequently occurring other nouns are achieve - ment disadvantage comfort consolation cruelty custom de  light desire dream duty embarrassment encouragement error  folly frustration fun habit hell honour intention job joy luxu - ry madness miracle misfortune mistake nonsense outrage pity  plan pleasure privilege relief rule shame surprise torture treat  triumph trouble wonder and some others. The infinitive has ap - positive  meaning in this sentence pattern.  e.g. Its a good idea to use both methods.  Its our job to worry about that isnt it?  It was a mistake to deny it.  But it was a surprise to hear him insisting on it.  It was utter nonsense to suggest that he was lying.  It was my intention to show her how greatly she had underes - timated me.  It must be a terrible thing to have received a classical edu - cation she said soberly.  Its a great disadvantage to be held back by middle -class mo - rality.  It was a bitter experienc e for Philip to learn that his best  friend had let him down.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the infinitive see Verbs  166.  For comparison with the ing -form see  231 and 243.   207. The infinitive is also used as at tribute in a sentence  pattern with it as a formal object of a verb. It is mainly found af - ter the verbs to find to make and to think.  e.g. I think Helena finds it rather a lot of work to clean the place.  Everyone now called him Reggie but he still found  it an ef - fort to get used to it.  He thought it great fun to be out boating.  He made it a point to call her by her first name.  He had made it a rule to get up at sunrise.  He found it a good idea to send them a telegram.  For the means of expressing the su bject of the action denoted  by the infinitive see Verbs  166.  The construction is not of frequent use in English though it is  not restricted to any style.  For comparison with the ing-form see  232.  The Infinitive as Parenthesis   208. The infinitive  as parenthesis is used with to. It is gener - ally a set phrase such as so to speak strange needless to say to  be quite frank to make matters worse to put it mildly crudely  to say the least to tell the truth and some others.  The infinitive phras e as parenthesis serves either to show the  speakers attitude towards the situation described in the sentence  or to attract attention to some fact or to sum up an idea and last  but not least it may serve as some sort of reservation on the part  of the sp eaker.  e.g. To tell the truth Im sick and tired of this nonsense.  To put it mildly she is just a bit inquisitive.  To make matters worse it began to rain and soon we got wet  to the skin.  When they found out I was not one of them so to speak they polit ely turned from me and ignored me.  The place of the parenthetic phrase in the sentence is not  fixed though it is actually often found at the head of the sen - tence. In writing it is marked off by a comma.  The Use of the ing -form  The ing -form as Subject   209. The ing-form  in the function of subject usually express - es permanent or recurrent actions simultaneous with the action  expressed by the predicate verb  e.g. Looking after one man is really enough but two is rather an  undertaking.  Passing a law about  equal rights doesnt necessarily mean  that women get them.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the ing -form see Verbs  166.  Sentences with the ing-form as subject have certain structural  peculiarities  1 We find the ing-form  as subject only in declarative sentenc - es. It is never used in interrogative sentences.  2 The ing-form as subject is always placed at the head of the  sentence. It is never preceded by any secondary parts.  3 The ing-form  as subject is occasionally found in  sentences  beginning with there is but its use is restricted to negative sen - tences where it is usually preceded by no. This pattern is common  in spoken English.  e.g. There was no arguing with her about it when she had made  up her mind.  Well there is no avoiding him now.  Of course I am scared to hell. Theres no denying that.  On the whole however the use of the ing -form as subject is  mainly found in literary English but even here it is not of fre - quent occurrence.  For comparison with the infinitive see  181 and 235.  The ing-form  as Predicative   210. The ing-form  as predicative is usually used after the  link-verbs to be to mean and to look and has appositive meaning.  e.g. The important part is helping people so that they can live  normal lives.  I cant ask him for help. That would mean telling him every - thing about you and myself.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the ing-form  see Verbs  166.  The ing-form  as predicative is often preceded by like. It also  has appositive meaning here but the explanation is made by way  of comparison.  e.g. To read his novels was like swimming in a lake so clear that  you could see the bottom.  At the time their quarrel looked like going on for ever.  Andrew looked like a small boy being teased.  Instances of the ing-form as predicative are scarce.  Note. The ing -form as predicative is sometimes adjectivized.  e.g. That must be enormously exciting.  The journey was slow rough and tiring and took us eleven days.  Hughs tone got more and more insulting.  If the ing-form were not adjectivized it would be taken for a continuous form.  e.g. The quarrel ought to be stopped. They are insulting each other.  For comparison with the infinitive see  182 and 236.  The ing-form  as Predicate   211. The ing-iorm as predicate is restricted to two sentence  patterns  1 interrogative sentences beginning with what about and how  about and implying suggestion  e.g. What about going to London?  How about seeing what they are doing now?  2 exclamatory sentenc es expressing indignation  e.g. But letting him do it!  Sentences of both kinds are quite common in spoken English.  For comparison with the infinitive see  183.  The ing-form  as Part of a Compound Verbal Predicate   212. The ing form is lexically depende nt in this function  it is used after a number of verbs denoting motion or position.  They are to come to disappear to go to go out round around  about to lie to sit to sit around round to stand to stand  around round.  e.g. They came rushing  in laughing.  They had often gone fishing in those days.  Are we going out dancing tonight?  He went about sniffing the air but there was no trace of gas.  They all sat around feeling very proud.  Im ready he said to Maurice and stood waiting.  Next morni ng I woke early and lay listening to the clatter of  dishes in the kitchen.  He disappeared walking there was no noise nothing.  The two verbs of the combination form a close sense -unit. The  first component has a weakened meaning and mainly serves as a fi - nite verb while the meaning of the ing-form is quite prominent  and determines the meaning of the whole combination.  e.g. In that mood I entered the bedroom where Sheila was lying  reading her book near the bedside lamp.  Sometimes she fell into despondenc y and sat doing nothing at  all neither reading nor sewing for half an hour at a time.  Note. Note the following set phrases  e.g. I burst out laughing and the others followed.  All at once she burst out crying.  For comparison with the infinitive see  184 . The ing -form as a Second Action Accompanying  the astion of the predicate verb.  the Action of the Predicate Verb   213. The  ing-form  may express a second action accom - anying the action expressed by the predicate verb. The subject of  the ing-form is the same as the subject of the sentence.  The ing-form  in this function refers not to the predicate verb  alone but to the whole predicate group. It does not form any close  sense -unit with the predicate verb and can be found with verbal  as well as with nomina l predicates.  The ing-form  is not lexically dependent in this function.  e.g. They ran up the stairs brimming with excitement.  ou cant just sit there being talked about.  I felt uneasy being alone with him in that large house.  Martha was upstairs getting r eady.  When I looked up he was still there waiting for me.  She was sitting in the doorway of the tent reading.  As a rule the ing-form follows the predicate group see the  examples above. But it may also be placed at the head of the sen - tence or between the subject and the predicate  e.g. Coming into my office one evening in the autumn he said  shyly Doing anything tonight?  Watching them with bold excited eyes Simon discussed their  characters . I made to go out but Roger frowning shook his head.  In the taxi going home Margaret holding my hand against  her cheek said You made a mistake you know.  Note 1. When the ing -form is used to denote a second action it is often sepa - rated by a comma from the rest of the sentence.  Note 2. The ing -forms of  certain verbs have come to be used as prepositions or  conjunctions. Care should be taken to distinguish them from the real ing forms.  e.g. Several officials including me had been invited.  He says he will be at the meeting place for three nights running next week  beginning on Monday.  Well considering that Hectors a politician you cant say that hes altogether  a fool.  Presuming the old man gets better and comes back to the job then what?  Supposing you sold the land what could you get for it?  That wi ll be all right barring accidents I told him at once.  Note 3. Note that taking all things into consideration account has become a  set phrase  e.g. Taking all things into consideration I decided to tear my letter up.  In the vast majority of sentences w e find a simple ing-iorm  which expresses an action simultaneous with that of the predicate  verb see the examples above. Yet if both the predicate verb and  the ing -form are expressed by terminative verbs the action of the  ing-form precedes that of the pr edicate verb. The ing -form in this  case is placed before the predicate  e.g. Turning to his hostess he remarked Its been a nice day.  He first turned to his hostess and then remarked.  Recovering from his excitement he became practical again.  Smith  turning to him gave a serious contented smile.  The use of the perfect ing-form though quite possible is not  of frequent occurrence. It shows that the action of the ing-form   precedes that of the predicate verb. The Perfect ing -form is often  placed bef ore the predicate verb.  e.g. Having duly arrived in Scotland he took a train the next day  to Manchester.  Having cut her dirty bandage John started tying her hand.  Having gradually wasted his small fortune he preferred to  live on the generosity of others  rather than work.  Francis was there before me having come by the morning  train . Norman having looked at his watch slapped the play -script  shut and put it on his chair.  As has been said the subject of the ing form is usually the  person or thing denoted  by the subject of the sentence see the ex - amples above. Occasionally however we come across instances of  the ing form whose subject is expressed elsewhere for instance  by one of the secondary parts of the sentence.  e.g. Walking beside his friend i t seemed to Norman that life was  not so bad after all.  But back in his office looking down at his desk his sense of  well-being left him.  I love you like hell Bridget. And loving you like hell you  cant expect me to enjoy seeing you get married to a po t- bellied pompous little peer who loses his temper when he  doesnt win at tennis.  But searching for is not dotted ts uncrossed in his letter  it came to him that all he had written were lies big lies  poured over the paper like a thick syrup.  The abov e use of the ing -form is not common. Since usually  the subject of the ing -form is the same person or thing as the sub - ject of the sentence it is not easy to identify the subject of the  ing-form in sentences of the above kind. Hence the term dangling  or unattached is applied to this ing -form in grammar.  The ing -form denoting a second action in the kind of sentences  illustrated above is typical of literary style where its use is quite  extensive but it is hardly ever used in spoken English.  However the in g-form denoting a second action is quite com - mon in spoken English after certain predicate groups. Here belong  the verbs to spend and to waste when they are followed by the  noun time or some other expressions of time and also after to  have a good hard  jolly etc. time to have difficulty to have  trouble and some others  e.g. She did little typing herself but spent her time correcting the  work of the four girls she employed.  Are you going to spend your life saying ought like the  rest of our moral ists?  She told me that she would often spend a whole morning  working upon a single page.  Well Im sure I dont know why I waste time cooking a big  meal for this family if no one wants to eat it.  He had a good time dancing at the club.  They had difficulty finding his address.  In spoken English there is another sentence pattern in which  the ing-form denoting a second action is also quite common. The  sentence pattern includes the verb to be followed by an indication  of place to be here there to be in to be in the room kitchen  garden office etc. to be out to be upstairs downstairs and the  like.  e.g. Mother is out shopping.  Pat is downstairs talking to Father.  Miss Smith was in her office typing.  For comparison with the infinitive see  185.  The ing-form as Object   214. The ing-form  may be used as a direct object of a verb.  It is lexically dependent in this function and found after the fol - lowing verbs to admit to avoid to begin to cease to consider to  continue to delay to deny to end ure to enjoy to escape to fin - ish to forget to give up to go on to hate to intend to keep to  keep on to leave off to like to love to mention to mind in neg - ative and interrogative sentences to neglect to postpone to pre  fer to propos e  to suggest to put off to quit to recall to rec - ollect to regret to remember to resent to resume to risk to  start to stop to suggest to try and some others.  e.g. English grammar is very difficult and few writers have  avoided making mist akes in it.  The rest of us had finished eating but Cave had cut himself  another slice of cheese.  Roger went on speaking with energy calculation and warmth.  He kept on smiling at her and speaking.  He drank his beer and resumed reading his paper.  I was in low spirits and even considered going away.  David Rubin did not much like being called Professor.  In addition to the verbs mentioned in the list above the ing- iorm as object is used after certain modal phrases in the negative  form cant bear cant fac e cant fancy cant imagine cant re  sist cant stand and cant help.  e.g. They cant bear being humiliated.  He could not face being talked about.  Later in the day she couldnt resist calling Mrs Spark to find  out the details of the tragedy.  He couldn t help asking me Isnt there anything else you  can do for Roger?  Besides the ing-form is also used after the set phrase to feel  like. e.g. He felt like giving up the whole affair.  I didnt feel like talking to him after what had happened.  The subject o f the ing-form in this function is the same as  that of the predicate verb.  For comparison with the infinitive see  186 and 237.   215. The ing-form  may also serve as a direct object of an ad - jective. It is lexically dependent in this case and found o nly after  two adjectives   busy and worth.  e.g. The foreman was busy shouting orders and instructions.  The children were busy doing all the things they had been  told not to do.  He thought my idea was worth trying.  It was not a witticism worth repeating.  For comparison with the infinitive see  187 and 238.   216. As a prepositional object of a verb the ing -form is also  lexically dependent. It is found after verbs that take a preposition - al object. These verbs may be divided into three groups  1 verbs fo llowed by one prepositional object  2 verbs followed by a non -prepositional object and a preposi - tional object  3 verbs followed by two prepositional objects.  I. The verbs of the first group are closely connected with a  preposition whose meaning is often weak ened. The following is  the list of the most commonly used verbs to admit to to agree to  to aim at to apologize for to approve of to believe in to bother  about to care for to come of to come round to to complain of to  confess to to consist ofi n to count on to despair of to dream of  to end in to forget about to feel up to to get to to get down to to go back to to grumble about to hesitate about to insist on to lead  to to long for to mean by to persist in to plan on to reckon on  to refrain from to return to to result infrom to save from to  succeed in to take to to talk of to tell of to think ofabout to  threaten with to worry about and some others.  e.g. What did she mean by boasting like that?  I didnt think twice about telling her we had no secrets.  It does not seem impossible that the biologist will in the fu - ture succeed in creating life in his laboratory.  The readers of a book insist on knowing the reasons of action.  Lets get down to signing the papers.  Towards the end of the summer they visited me together  several times and then Norman took to coming alone.  I had never been on an aeroplane and worried about being  strapped down.  I must apologize for having interrupted a conference.  Here also belong certain set phrases such as to find excuses for  to have no doubt about to look forward to to lose time in to make a  point of to plead guilty to to take pride in and some others.  e.g. I took pride in making my lodgings pretty and comfortable.  He was taking risk s in speaking in that tone to them.  I expect you are looking forward to seeing your fiance again - Special attention should be given to set phrases with the verb  to be which are treated as verb equivalents.  e.g. Would you be up to playing with us this afte rnoon?  She was just on the point of going away when Betty Vane  came in.  Would you be in favour of investigating the matter? Mon - ty asked.  The subject of the action expressed by the ing -form is generally  the person denoted by the subject of the sentence see the examples  above. But occasionally we find an ing -complex see Verbs 66.  e.g. I dont in the least object to your playing practical jokes on  other people.  She complained about the porridge being lumpy.  The use of an ing -complex seems to be gen erally required by  the verbs to approve of to disapprove of to grumble about and some others. We usually approve of or grumble about some other  peoples actions   hence the agent of the ing -form is expected to  be a person or thing other than the one den oted by the subject of  the sentence.  e.g. He could not approve of Guys hiding himself away.  We cant grumble about things being dull can we?  II. Verbs requiring a non -prepositional and prepositional object  are in general less numerous. Besides not all of them take an ing - form as their prepositional object e.g. to explain something to  somebody to dictate something to somebody etc..  Of the verbs taking a non -prepositional and prepositional object  expressed by an ing form the most commonly occurring are to ac - cuse somebody of to amuse somebody with to ask somebody about  to charge somebody with to coax somebody into to give something  to to give something for to invite somebody into to keep some  body from to mutter something about to persuad e somebody into  to remind somebody of to restrict oneself to to save somebody  from to say something about to stop somebody from to suspect  somebody of to talk somebody intoout of to tell something about  and some others.  e.g- I am prepared for anyo ne to accuse me of being cowardly.  It had been easy to coax Margaret into inviting the Morgans  to stay with us for a week.  Did she suspect them of trying to cheat her?  I hope you wont let Peg talk you out of joining me?  It is lack of imagination that pre vents people from seeing  things from any point of view but their own.  Will you be able to keep those fellows from making any more  fuss?  Of all the prepositions there is one that acquires particular  importance in this construction as it may be found with a consid - erable number of verbs and is consequently of frequent occur - rence. It is the preposition for. It generally serves to indicate the  cause of the action denoted by the predicate verb.  For is found after the following verbs to blame somebody to  excuse somebody to forgive somebody to hate somebody to like  somebody  to love somebody to pay somebody to reprimand some  body to reproach somebody to scold somebody to thank somebody  and some others.  e.g. I thought you had just been blaming me for being neutral.  Im not going to reproach you for interrupting the rehearsal.  I was going to thank you for looking after him till I came.  The major reprimanded him for being late.  He scolded me for not having let him know.  The subject of the ing-form  in th is sentence pattern is the per - son denoted by the direct object as in She tried to talk him into doing it see also the examples above.  After verbs of speaking we often find an ing -complex.  e.g. I told them about Gustavs wanting to come with me.  I said  something about Jane being in love with him but he  would not talk about her.  I muttered something about its being a pity.  III. The number of verbs requiring two prepositional objects of  which the second is an ing-form  is limited. The ing-form is also in - troduced by the preposition for as with some verbs above  e.g. I entered the classroom and apologized to the teacher for be - ing late.  I should have been vexed with you for thinking me such a  fool.   217. The ing-form as a prepositional object is also found af - ter various kinds of adjectives   adjectives proper predicative  adjectives and adjectivized participles. The most commonly occur - ring of them are absorbed in unaccustomed to afraid of  amused at angry with annoyed at ashamed of aware o f incapable  of careful aboutin careless of certain of clever at unconscious  of content with delighted at different from embarrassed at ex  cited about far from fond of fortunate in frightened of furious  at given to good better at g rateful for happy inat interested  in irritated at keen on miserable at nice about pleased at proud  of responsible for right in scared atof set against set on sick of skilled inat slow in sorry for successful inat sure of sur - prised  at thankful for tired of touched at upset at unused to  worried about wrong in etc. e.g. If only I were capable of doing that!  We were never very careful about taking precautions.  You look for trouble dont you? Only because Im pretty  certai n of finding it.   I was fairly content with letting things go as they were.  Somehow I wasnt too interested in trying to get back into  that work.  I was tired of doing much the same thing every day.  Im sorry for giving you so much trouble she said.  I felt that he was excited about showing me his new car.  He was unconscious of Anna standing beside him.  For means of expressing the subject of the action denoted by  the ing -form see Verbs  166.  For comparison with the infinitive see  187 and 238.   218. The ing -form may serve as object of a verb in a special  sentence pattern with it as a formal subject. The use of the ing- form in this sentence pattern is found after a very limited number  of verbs and set phrases which are verb equivalents but it is  typical of spoken English.  e.g- He said to his wife It doesnt matter much being liked for  this kind of life.  When it comes down to getting a job with a living wage at - tached to it hes prepared to put his theories in his pocket.  She was as her co lleagues said good on paper but when it  came to speaking in committees she was so apprehensive  that she spent sleepless hours the night before.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the ing -form see  166.  For comparison wit h the infinitive see  189 and 239.   219. The ing -form may be used as a direct object of an adjec - tive in a sentence pattern with if as a formal subject. This kind of  object is also lexically dependent   it regularly occurs after it is worth.  e.g. It i s worth remembering that he has once been a boxer.  It is worth finding it out.  Sometimes the ing -form is found after a number of other ad - jectives such as amusing banal comfortable difficult dreary  easy great hopeless lovely nice odd pleasant strange tough  useless wonderful etc. e.g. It was difficult getting him to do it.  It wont be easy finding our way back. Theres not much moon.  It will be rather nice seeing him again.  It was useless arguing with Jane.  But the ing -form occurs after thes e adjectives only in spoken  English and such sentences are often emotionally coloured. As a  general rule we find an infinitive here see Verbs  190.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the ing -form see  166.   220. The ing-form is sometimes found in a sentence pattern  with it as a formal object of the verbs to find to make and to think. The formal it in this case is followed by an adjective.  e.g. He found it worth reminding her of her promise.  He thought it very odd my leaving when I did.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denote  by the ing -form see  166.  For comparison with the infinitive see  191.  The ing-form as Subjective Predicative   221. The ing -form as subjective predicative is lexically d e- pendent. It is found after a limited number of verbs in the pas - sive. These verbs are to catch to find to hear to leave to no - tice to report to see to set to show to watch.  e.g. I felt I had been caught boasting.  The baby was found sitting on the floor.  The old woman was heard shrieking in short bursts like a  ship in the fog.  When the door closed Monty and I were left looking at each  other.  About that time a hurricane was reported moving out of the  Caribbean in our direction.  Here also belon g a few verbs after which the ing -form is intro - duced by as. They are to accept to consider to explain to guaran - tee to mention to regard to take to treat to understand Here  also belong the verbs to speak of and to think of which retain  their p repositions in this sentence pattern.  e.g. The Browns did not entertain and were spoken of in the dis - trict as being poor as church mice.  Janet and I became very friendly and at school we were con - sidered as going together.  The use of the ing -form as subjective predicative is not of fre - quent occurrence.  For comparison with the infinitive see  192 and 240.  The ing-form as Objective Predicative   222. The ing -form as objective predicative is lexically depen - dent  it is used after a number of tran sitive verbs in the active  followed by an object which is expressed by a noun or a pronoun.  The following are the most frequently used verbs taking a direct  object to call to catch to discover to feel to find to hear to get  to imagine to keep to leave to dislike to notice to picture to  see to send to set to stop to watch to want.  e.g. I felt him looking at me now and again.  When he arrived he found me reading Tom Jones.  Just as I got to the end of the corridor I heard my telephone  ringing again.  Ellen had noticed me talking with the landlady.  He saw me watching him.  One afternoon in August I saw something that surprised me  and set me thinking.  This construction is also found after two verbs taking a prepo - sitional object   to listen to  and to look at.  e.g. We opened the door for a moment and looked out at the  windy night and listened to the trees groaning.  He looked at Jane wiping her tear -wet face.  Here also belong a few verbs after which the ing -form is intro - duced by as to accept to consider to explain to guarantee to  mention to regard to speak of to take to think of to treat to un  derstand.  e.g. You took his statement as being quite in order.  He has spoken of your relatives as though he would never ac - cept them as being his. We always thought of him as being promising.  With all the above verbs the object that precedes the ing-iorm  is expressed by a noun in the common case or by a personal pro - noun in the objective case and serves as subject of the action de - noted by  the ing form. But there are a number of other verbs after  which the object may be expressed either in the above described  way or by a noun in the genitive case or a possessive pronoun.  These verbs are to appreciate to dread to excuse to fancy to for - get to forgive to hate to have to imagine to mind to miss to par - don to prevent to recall to remember to resent to misunderstand  and also cant bear cant help and to catch sight of.  e.g. Forgive my me interrupting you Mr Passant but w ith a  school record like yours Im puzzled why you dont try for  a university scholarship?  I appreciate your you coming to my defense.  Do you recall Bayards Bayard doing that?  For comparison with the infinitive see  193 and 241.  The ing -form as A dverbial Modifier   223. The ing -form can serve as an adverbial modifier of a  verb. In this case it is preceded by a conjunction or a preposition  which lend it adverbial meanings such as time concession condi - tion attending circumstances manner caus e and some others.  The adverbial meaning of the ing-form  is determined by the mean - ing of the preceding conjunction or preposition. The ing-form  is not lexically dependent here   it may be used after any verb. For  the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted by the  ing-form  see Verbs  166.  224. The ing-form  may be preceded by the conjunctions  while when once if as though as if though than as well as  and the correlative conjunctions as...as and not so...as.  While and when lend the ing-form  the adverbial meaning of  time emphasizing the idea of simultaneousness of its action with  that of the predicate verb. While shows that both actions are tak - ing place at a given moment or period of time a when usually  serves to express re current actions simultaneous with the action  of the predicate verb b.  e.g. a He continued to speak while walking down the path.  The photograph showed himself shielding his eyes against  the sun while sitting on a swing.  b She picked up Butlers heavy s pectacles which she em - ployed always when reading and put them on.  Often when boasting of his deceits he sounded childlike  and innocent.  The conjunctions as though and as if serve to show that the  person denoted by the subject of the sentence appears to  be per - forming the action indicated by the ing-iorm there is something  in the manner or in the behaviour of the person that gives the im - pression that the action is being performed by himher.  e.g. Lena gave me a very long look indeed as though seeing me for the first time.  Much of the afternoon I looked out of the window as though  thinking but not really thinking.  He listened as though brooding.  She stopped speaking as if waiting for him to speak.  The use of the other conjunctions is infrequent.  e.g. Himself a man of little or no education though possessing  remarkable shrewdness he placed little value on what he  called book knowledge.  He always dropped in if passing by their house on a wet night.  Ive got a comfortable home to take you to and you ll be your  own mistress which is much better than being in service.  Mary brought in the coffee and when she had gone he inhaled  the steam of it. It was as good as drinking it.  Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern.  The use of the ing-form  in this f unction is found mainly in lit - erary style and even there it is not frequent.  Note. The ing-form may acquire adverbial meaning even when it is not preced - ed by a conjunction. But this use of the  ing-form is still less frequent. For example  in the senten ces below the ing-form has the following meanings  cause   Seeing their uneasiness Mrs Norris softened and smiled.  Knowing he could not go to Alice he tried to telephone her.  time  I know we shall break our necks one night walking across the field  manner   They walked by the lake holding hands.  concession   But why did he marry her feeling as he did about everything?  condition    Oh do go upstairs Lizzy! Youll only catch a cold  hanging  around the passage.   225. The ing-form may be preceded by the p repositions after  before besides by except for for fear of for the sake of from in  instead of on on the verge of through without and some others  The most frequently used of them is without showing that an ac - tion which may be logically expect ed to accompany the action of  the predicate verb does not take place.  e.g. The bus passed us without stopping.  In a mutter he thanked her without raising his eyes.  I watched her for a little while without being seen.  Then he left us without saying good -bye. As is seen from the above examples the ing-form is placed af - ter the predicate verb. Its position at the beginning of the sentence  or between the subject and predicate though possible is unusual.  e.g. Slowly without turning his head he pulled himse lf to a half - sitting position.  Roger without turning to me said in a curt flat and even  tone There may possibly be trouble.  A synonymous construction with not preceding an ing-iorm  does not imply the idea that the action is logically expected. Like  any other ing-iorm it simply denotes a second action. Only in this  case it is in the negative form see Verbs  213.  e.g. I returned to the drawing -room and stood preoccupied not noticing acquaintances about the room with my back to  the fire.  We h ad both sat for a long time not speaking in the quiet I knew she was not reading.  The ing-form  preceded by not is typical of literary style  whereas the ing-form preceded by without is in common use in lit - erary as well as in spoken English.  Another fr equently occurring preposition which may precede  the ing-form  is by. In this case the action denoted by the ing-iorm  expresses a means or a method of performing the action of the  predicate verb. It may also indicate the manner in which the action  of the p redicate verb is carried out.  e.g. You begin learning a language by listening to the new sounds.  He greeted me noisily but I cut him short by giving him the  telegram.  I dont want to distress her by telling her that you have be - haved like a cad.  I have my dignity to think of. One often preserves that  best by putting it in ones pocket.  This ing-form  is generally placed after the predicate verb  though its front position is occasionally possible.  e.g. By keeping quiet she might save herself a lot of trouble.  The ing-form  introduced by instead of is also in common use. It is characterized by a clear -cut meaning owing to the preposition  itself. Its position with regard to the predicate verb is not fixed.  e.g. Why do you tuck your umbrella under your l eft arm instead  of carrying it in your hand like anything else?  You positively help them instead of hindering them.  He bought pictures instead of buying me the things I wanted.  I persuaded my uncle that it would be very good for my  lungs if instead of sta ying at school I spent the following  winter on the Riviera.  The use of the ing -form with other prepositions is less common.  The ing -forms following the prepositions before after and on express time relations between the action of the predicate verb  and th at of the ing-form . Before shows that the action expressed by the ing-form follows  that of the predicate verb. It is usually placed in post -position to  the predicate verb.  e.g. He waited a long while before answering.  He had given her two pots of geraniums  before leaving for  London last week.  They were sitting there now before going out to dinner.  After indicates that the action expressed by the ing-form pre- cedes the action expressed by the predicate verb.  e.g. After glancing at his watch he said in a bu sinesslike tone  Youve made me a bit late.  After staying away eighteen years he can hardly expect us to  be very anxious to see him.  But after hesitating a moment or two Jiggs knocked on the  door.  On expresses the same relations as after. But on emphasi zes the idea of an immediate succession of the two actions   the ac - tion of the predicate verb begins at the moment the action of the  ing-form is accomplished. It is noteworthy that we find only the  ing-forms of terminative verbs here.  e.g. On arriving at  the cottage she found it locked.  On getting up in the morning I found a letter on my doorstep  Mr Doyle came in as a man at home there but on seeing the  stranger he shrank at once.  As is seen from the above examples the ing-form introduced  by after and on is usually placed before the predicate verb.  The meaning of the ing -form introduced by in is not so clear - cut. It may be defined as limiting the sphere of application for  the action denoted by the predicate verb or as indicating a process  during which  the action of the predicate verb is performed.  e.g. Ive done something rather foolish in coming here tonight I  regret it.  In defending myself against this lady I have a right to use  any weapon I can find.  I daresay you have noticed that in speaking to you I have  been putting a very strong constraint on myself.  The place of the ing -form preceded by in is not fixed.  The use of ing -forms introduced by other prepositions is still  less frequent. We find various prepositions here.  e.g. It was a lesson he had learned from having seen so many acci - dents.  I found that besides being a philosopher he was an uncommonly  good writer.  We talked in whispers for fear of disturbing the Smiths.  It was very quiet in the wood except for our feet breaking  twigs.  They were po litical link -men who added to their incomes  through leaking secret information to the press.  As for staying with your uncle for a while Im convinced  youll enjoy every minute of it.  It should be noted that the use of the ing-form described above  is styli stically neutral   it is found in literary as well as in spo - ken English. However care should be taken to remember that ing - forms preceded by after before and on are not in common use.  Adverbial clauses of time are much more frequent.  Note. Note that i n the following sentences we are dealing with set phrases  e.g. He said in passing that money didnt matter much since his wife was so rich.  They were to do nothing for the time being.  It goes without saying that healthy men are happier than sick men.  For comparison with the infinitive see  195 -201.  226. The subject of the ing -form in the adverbial functions  described above is the same person or thing as denoted by the sub - ject of the sentence. But the ing -form may have a subject of its  own with which  it forms the so -called absolute construction.  e.g. He gave an intimate smile some of the freshness returning  to his face.  His study was a nice room with books lining the walls.  There are two parallel actions in this sentence pattern   one of them is exp ressed by the predicate verb the other by the ing- iorm. Each action has its own subject.  Absolute constructions may be of two kinds non -prepositional  and prepositional introduced by the preposition with. They are  both lexically independent.  The non -prepositional construction and the prepositional con - struction are synonymous.  Absolute constructions while serving to denote a second ac - tion parallel to that of the predicate verb acquire at the same  time adverbial meanings and thereby stand in specific  relations to  the main part of the sentence.  The most commonly occurring meaning of the absolute con - struction is to describe the appearance the behaviour or inner  state characterizing the person denoted by the subject of the sen - tence. Non -prepositiona l a as well as prepositional b construc - tions serve this purpose. This meaning of the absolute construc - tion may be called descriptive circumstances.  e.g. a Finally she stood back and looked at him her face radiant - ly smiling.  But its so ridicul ous that we dont know what to do  William told them his voice rising in indignation.  She kept on running her heart thumping furiously her steps quickening in pace with her heartbeats  b The man was leaning forward in his seat with his head  resting in his hands.  He struggled on panting for breath and with his heart  beating wildly.  He went into the house with a curious sadness pressing  upon him.  Another meaning of the absolute construction is to describe  the circumstances attending the action of the  predicate verb  serving as its background as it were. It may also be expressed by  non-prepositional a and prepositional b constructions.  e.g. a When we entered the sitting -room she was sitting with her sister before an open fire -place the glow of a lamp with  a red -flowered shade warmly illuminating the room.  Then they were out in the cold night fresh snow crunch - ing noisily underfoot.  b The night was clean with a new moon silvering the trees  along the road and an energetic wind tidying away the clouds.  With a hurricane approaching we prepared to stand a seige.  Absolute constructions may acquire the adverbial meaning of  cause when the action denoted by the absolute construction indi - cates the cause of the action denoted by the predicate verb. This  meaning is also expressed by non -prepositional constructions a  and prepositional constructions b.  e.g. a Death being contrary to their principles the Forsytes took  precautions against it.  A room lit up on the third storey someone working late b I cant write with you standing there.  By twelve oclock with the sun pouring into the room  the heat became oppressive.  Finally absolute constructions can serve as some kind of addi - tional explanation of the statement made in the main part of the  sentence. In this case the absolute construction acquires more se - mantic independence   it seems to be on a par with the predicate  verb. This meaning is mainly expressed by the non -prepositional  construction.  e.g. Everyone in the house was busy Nessie frow ning over her les - sons Mumma deeply engaged in her novel Grandma sleep - ing in her armchair.  There were two serious accidents in the West Country one in - volving a coach and a car.  English words can be classed as variable and invariable the latter bei ng much more numerous than in the other Euro - pean languages.  Absolute constructions are generally characteristic of literary  style where their use is quite extensive. In spoken English we mainly find the prepositional absolute construction.  For compariso n with the infinitive see  202.  The ing-form as Attribute   227. The ing-form  in the function of attribute is found in  different constructions.  The ing-form  may immediately precede its head -noun. In this  case it expresses an action which is performed by the person or  thing denoted by the head -noun i.e. the head -noun is the subject  of the action expressed by the ing-iorm. The ing -form is always a  single word in this case not an extended phrase. This attribute is  not lexically dependent   it may modif y any noun.  e.g. There was nothing to be seen or heard not even a barking dog. Passing the Comedy Theatre I happened to look up and saw  the clouds lit by the setting sun.  I reached for a cigarette with trembling hands and lit it.  Singing people arm in a rm filled the streets.  This kind of attribute is not of frequent occurrence in En - glish. However ing -forms appear to be quite common as at - tributes when they are used metaphorically.  e.g. They delivered their views on the burning questions of the day.  Arthur gave a creaking laugh.  Hungry said Mrs Nenneker in a trumpeting voice.  Carbury cocked an inquiring eye at him.  He watched it with despairing incredulity.  It is characteristic of the ing -form in this function to become  adjectivized   the ing -form  is devoid of the idea of action in this  case and its lexical meaning is often changed as compared with the  meaning of the corresponding verb e.g. a charming girl means a  very nice girl an amusing story is an interesting funny story a promising wri ter is a talented writer For adjectivization see also  Verbs 172.  e.g. We had a very good view of all the surrounding scenery.  A desolate loneliness settled on me   almost a frightening  loneliness.  In her ringing voice she turned to the man on her right  Reggie what do you think I ought to do?  They were preoccupied with the coming debate.  Such adjectivized ing -forms are in common use in English. An - other peculiar feature of the ing -form in this function is its ten - dency to form in combination  with its head -noun a set phrase  e.g. the reading public the presiding magistrate a racing man  working people a fighting officer a leading politician revolving  doors running water a booking office a publishing house closing  time walking shoes  etc.  228. The ing -form as attribute may closely follow its head - noun. It also expresses an action performed by the person or thing  denoted by the head -noun i.e. the head -noun is the subject of the  ing-iorm. But unlike the ing -form in pre -position to the noun it  I is a more or less extended group not a single word. This kind of  attribute is not lexically dependent   it may modify any noun.  Yet its use is structurally dependent when it serves to modify a  noun after there is are.  e.g. There are some people coming in here now.  There is a lot of work waiting for me to do.  Arent you coming to the music room? Not if there is any music going on.  There was a man hurrying down the street in front of me.  We find the structurally dependent use of the ing -form in  coming on in up when it modifies a noun which is an object of  the verb to have to have got.  e.g. I saw at once he had an attack of malaria coming on. Sam thinks that he ought to return home by the next boat. He  has got his exams coming on.  Youve got too many things coming up to get involved in such  an affair.  This kind of attribute is used in literary as well as in spoken  English.  Note. It is noteworthy that running in post -position to a plural noun is used in  the meaning of one after anothe r in succession.  e.g. He says he has received three telegrams running from them.   229. In all other instances the use of the ing -form as at - tribute in post -position is free. It is a loose attribute in this case  and hence may be separated from its h ead-noun by a pause. In all  other respects this attribute is similar to the structurally depen - dent one the head -noun is also the subject of the ing-form  and the ing -form is generally part of a more or less extended group.  This kind of attribute is nei ther lexically nor structurally de - pendent   it can modify any noun and the noun can have differ  ent syntactic functions in the sentence.  e.g. I could hear the voices of the kids waiting for the school bell  to ring.  They stumbled on the snow turning to icy water.  Then I picked up a booklet depicting various scenes of Navy  life. The loose character of the ing -form in this function is always  marked off by intonation and it may also sometimes be indicated  by the use of a comma.  e.g. The wardrobe was empty e xcept for one dress swinging on a hanger.  The door was opened by one of the man -servants bearing an envelope addressed to me in Collingwoods bold hand.  This loose attribute is frequently used in literary style but is  not typical of spoken English.   23 0. The ing-form  in the function of attribute may be pre - ceded by a preposition. In this case it always follows its head - noun and is generally part of an extended phrase. The ing-form  is lexically dependent here.  In most cases the ing form is preceded b y the preposition of and the attribute acquires appositive meaning i.e. serves to ex - plain the meaning of its head -noun. That is why it can modify only  certain abstract nouns that admit of and sometimes even require  an explanation of their meaning. The n umber of nouns thus used  is quite considerable. The most commonly occurring of them are  action disadvantage adventure aim appearance art attitude  business capacity case chance charge choice discomfort com  plication conception consequen ce consideration consolation  inconvenience cost custom danger delight difficulty disap  pointment disgrace effect emotion enterprise evidence expendi  ture expense experience fact fascination favour fear feeling - gesture gift grief  guilt habit honour hope horror humiliation.  idea ignorance illusion impertinence importance impression in -  cident initiative instant intention interest issue job joke joy  labour lightness limit love t luck luxury madness magnifi cence  manner means medium memory merit method misery misfor - tune mistake moment motion movement necessity notion object  opinion opportunity pain pity pleasure point policy possibility  power precaution pretence pride privilege process proof pros - pect purpose question relief reputation result risk role routine  rule satisfaction sensation sense shame shock sign signal sin sorrow sort speciality stage level standard state success sup - port surprise symptom talent task terror thought trick trouble   use way week wisdom work and some others.  e.g. He said that he had no chance of learning the truth.  I dont want her to make a habit of being late. I have no hope of discussing it Mr Birling.  There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  I had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad some  weeks ago.  The prospect of travelling with two elderly very dull people  made me regret my hasty decision yesterday.  He admired his way of doing things  very much.  After a while I began to have a feeling of being watched.  Miss Moss gave no sign of having heard his words.  She experienced an unreasonable feeling of having been cheated.  Her parents are terribly upset at the thought of her giving ev- idence.   The ing -form may also be preceded by the prepositions for in  at about and to. But they are by far less common than of. These  prepositions are found after a limited number of nouns which reg - ularly require their use  for  cause excuse genius gift grounds motive passion  pretext reason reputation talent  in  advantage belief believer difficulty experience harm  hesitation ingenuity meaning object participation  pleasure point purpose sense skill use  at  amazement astonishment  attempt delight dismay ir - ritation pleasure satisfaction shyness surprise  about   fantasy obsession scruples  to  objection preparation.  e.g. She had a real passion for reading detective stories.  Did he have any special reason for doing that ? There was no point in going further.  I saw no harm in asking a few questions.  He felt irritation at being disturbed.  I was making up my mind to another attempt at persuading  him to do it.  After three months I got an obsession about having a place of  my o wn. Certainly I should have no objection to working with the man.  For the means of expressing the subject of the action denoted  by the ing-form see Verbs  166.  This ing -form is not restricted to any particular style and is  widely used in English.  For comparison with the infinitive see  203 -204 242.   231. The ing-form may be used as an attribute in a sentence  pattern with it as a formal subject. The ing-form  is lexically de - pendent here   it is regularly used only after it is no good and it is no  use with appositive meaning.  e.g. Its no use lamenting over things that are past and done with.  Its no use going on like this he said.  Its no good trying to fool yourself about love.  Its no good my saying Im sorry for what Ive done. That  would be  hypocritical.  If she had made up her mind to anything it was no good our  opposing her.  Note. We also find a synonymous construction there is no use followed by an  ing-form.  e.g. There was no use pretending that they were different from the others.  There w as no use complaining.  This construction is less common than the one with the formal if still less  common is the pattern in which the ing-form is preceded by the preposition in.  e.g. You can see now theres no use in trying to make him understand.  Sometim es the ing -form occurs after a number of other nouns  which are as a rule semantically pale such as thing business  chance idea problem and some others. The nouns are usually  modified by an adjective which is semantically more important  than the noun.  e.g. In this filthy weather its the hardest thing in the world get - ting things dry.  Id like to give it to him myself. Its not the same thing send - ing it in a letter.  Its been a great chance my meeting you like this.  Itll be such a surprise to her seeing you.  It should be mentioned however that the ing -form is not  common after these nouns. We normally find an infinitive here  see Verbs  206. The use of this ing -form is mainly restricted  to spoken English.  For the means of expressing the subje ct of the action denoted  I by the ing -form see Verbs  166.   232. The ing -form may also be used as an attribute in a sen - tence pattern with it as a formal object of the verbs to find to  think and to make. The formal it in its turn is followed by a  noun. It is to this noun that the ing -form serves as an attribute.  e.g. Wont you find it rather a bore having me at home for so long?  It should be noted that this construction is of rare occurrence.  For comparison with the infinitive see  207.  The ing-form  as Parenthesis   233. The ing -form as parenthesis tends to become a set phrase.  We mainly find here the verbs to talk and to speak. The ing -form  as parenthesis serves to denote some sort of reservation on the part  of the speaker or else it is used as  an introductory phrase meaning  incidentally compare with the Russian  . e.g. Secrets generally speaking are not very well kept nowadays  with reporters and television cameras all around us.  Roughly speaking it might have been said that youth and  hope in women touched him.  Talking about crime I can lend you rather a good book as  you are interested in the subject.  Of course strictly speaking the excuse was not necessary.  The ing form as parenthesis is in most cases placed at the head  of the sentence and in writing marked off by a comma.  The Infinitive and the ing-form Compared   234. The infinitive and the ing-form  sometimes have similar  functions in the sentence and it is therefore necessary to define  the spheres of their application.  The distinction between the two verbals partly lies in their dif - ferent ten se and aspect characteristics. The infinitive tends to ex - press a single action following that of the predicate verb while  the ing -form generally serves to denote permanent actions simul - taneous with that of the predicate verb. These characteristics r e- fer to the simple forms of the infinitive and the ing -form. Their  Perfect forms are infrequent and do not play an important part in  distinguishing between the two verbals. But it should be noted  that we are dealing here only with tendencies not with h ard and  fast rules. For that reason the difference between the infinitive  and the ing -form sometimes becomes obliterated.  In most cases however the differentiation between the two  verbals rests on linguistic tradition which finds its expression in  the fo llowing  1 the infinitive and the ing -form have a different frequency  of occurrence in certain functions and the preference of one form  to the other cannot be accounted for by any tangible reasons  grammatical or semantic  2 the infinitive and the ing -form a re in certain functions lexi - cally dependent which means that their choice is determined by  their head -word but not by any grammatical properties inherent  in them  3 the infinitive and the ing -form are sometimes structurally  dependent i.e. their use is d etermined by definite sentence patterns  4 the infinitive and the ing -form may become part of a set  phrase.  Besides in some of the functions there are a few additional  factors which affect the choice between the two verbals. The in - finitive for instance may acquire modal meaning which is never  expressed by the ing -form. The ing -form in its turn when preced - ed by prepositions or conjunctions can express different mean - ings not typical of the infinitive. In certain functions the infini - tive of termi native verbs serves to express accomplished actions  while the ing form shows the action in its progress.  The Perfect infinitive may as well as the Perfect ing -form  denote actions preceding that of the predicate verb. But the Per - fect infinitive can al so in certain positions express unreality.  On the whole the differentiation between the infinitive and  the ing -form is well defined and the choice between them does not  present much difficulty as in most functions there is no overlap.  To prevent possib le mistakes in the cases where they do overlap it is necessary to compare the two verbals where they are used in a  parallel way.  The Infinitive and the ing-form as Subject   235. Neither the infinitive nor the ing -form as subject is  common in English so the distinction between them is not very  important for practical purposes.  The differentiation between the infinitive and the ing -form as  subject is on the one hand determined by their respective tense  and aspect characteristics   the infinitive tends to  denote an ac - tion following that of the predicate verb a while the ing -form  mainly serves to express an action simultaneous with that of the  predicate verb b.  e.g. a To win the worlds greatest cycling event became the ambi - tion of his life.  b Be atrice and I dont correspond unless there is a major  event in the family. Writing letters is a waste of time.  On the other hand the choice between the infinitive and the  ing-form is to a certain extent determined by the usage. Accord - ing to tradition t he ing -form is preferred in this function and the  infinitive is by far less frequent. Sometimes however the use of  the infinitive is required by an additional factor namely the abili - ty of the infinitive to express the modal meaning of condition.  e.g. To go to them with an accusation would be absurd.  The Infinitive and the ing -form as Predicative   236. As predicative the infinitive and the ing -form may both  have the same appositive meaning. The difference between them is  mainly determined by tradition   the infinitive a is in common  use in English whereas instances of the ing -form b are scarce.  e.g. a The job of a reporter is to expose and to record.  All one could do was try to make the future less hard  b The important part is helping people so  that they can live  normal lives.  Yet the infinitive is used only after the link -verb to be while  the ing-form. is found after other link -verbs particularly to mean.  e.g. That would mean telling him everything.  Still another point of difference is that o nly an ing-form is used after to be like. The ing-form has appositive meaning here  but the explanation is made by way of comparison.  e.g. Philip tries to direct his mind to the question but it is like trying to press the like poles of two magnets together.  They push away.  The Infinitive and the ing-form  as Object   237. As an object of a verb the infinitive and the ing -form  are lexically dependent.  According to a well -established tradition a number of verbs  are followed by the infinitive for the list s ee Verbs  186  while certain other verbs require the use of the ing-form for the  list see Verbs  214. Yet after a few verbs it is possible to use  either of the two verbals.  The overlap in the use of the infinitive and the ing form is  however c aused by several reasons  1 The head -verb is sometimes polysemantic and requires the  use of the infinitive in one of its meanings while in another it  must be followed by an ing-iorm. Here belong the verbs to try to  propose and to go on.  To try in the mea ning of to make an effort or attempt1 is used with an infinitive a while in the meaning of to test to  make an experiment it is followed by an ing-form  b. e.g. a Ill try to do what I can.  Someone said We mustnt try to run before we can walk . b The young writer dissatisfied with the result of his work  tried altering words or the order in which they were set.  As we couldnt understand his English he tried speaking  French to us.  It should be noted however that to try is much more common  in the meaning of to make an effort and hence it is usually fol - lowed by the infinitive.  To propose in the meaning of to intend is used with the infin - itive a while in the meaning of to put forward for consider - ation it is followed by the ing-form  b e.g. a Tell me more about how you propose to start your business.  He did not propose to forgive them this time  b What do you propose doing?  To go on in the meaning of to do next or afterwards requires  an infinitive a whereas in the meanin g of to continue it is fol - lowed by an ing-form b. e.g. a She went on to say that he was a man one could trust com - pletely.  The shopkeeper went on to explain that these little wood - en figures were by no means comparable to the mass - produced figure s. b Tom went on talking.  But you cant go on living in this way any longer.  Note. The verb to mean in the meaning of to intend is followed by an infini - tive a. But when to mean is followed by an ing-form it is a link -verb denoting to  signify to  have as a consequence. The ing-form is not an object in this case it is  used in the function of a predicative b.  e.g. a Do you mean to say he actually approves of it?  b To love a woman means giving up everything else he said.  2 With certain othe r verbs the overlap in the use of the infin - itive and the ing -form is accounted for by their tense and aspect  characteristics. This is found after the verbs to remember to for - get and to regret. The infinitive expresses an action following that  of the p redicate verb a while the ing-form  denotes a preceding  action b.  e.g. a Bart remembered to count five before answering his father  b I remember saying to him Look here if anyone acted like  you the world couldnt go on.  a I forgot to tell John ab out the party.  b I shall never forget testifying in that trial twelve years  ago. a I regret to say it but you shouldnt believe everything he  tells you.  b He regretted hurting her feelings.  It should be noted that owing to their lexical meaning the  verbs to remember and to regret are in most cases followed by an  ing-form. Conversely with the verb to forget the situation gener - ally calls for an infinitive.  3 With some other verbs the infinitive and the ing-form  seem  to be interchangeable. These verbs ar e to begin to cease to con  tinue to dread to hate to intend to like to love to neglect to  prefer and to start.  However after to begin to cease and to continue the infinitive  is commonly found while to start to like and to hate are more of  ten followed by an ing -form.  Note 1. Care should be taken to remember that there are other verbs in English  denoting the beginning the continuation or the end of an action which are associat - ed with only one of the two verbals. Thus to commence and to set o ut are used with  an infinitive. Yet to finish to keep to keep on to leave off and to set about take an ing -form.  Note 2. After the verb to stop the object is always expressed by an ing -form  e.g. She stopped speaking as though waiting for him to speak . The infinitive after to stop can serve only as an adverbial modifier of purpose.  It is usually separated from the verb to stop by an object or an adverbial modifier.  e.g. As I stopped at the bar to have a drink I saw them talking it over.  If the infiniti ve happens to follow the head -verb immediately it is to be regard - ed as accidental. Examples of this kind are of rare occurrence.  e.g. I stopped to ask if you were better. They told me you were on duty.  Note 3. The infinitive and the ing -form may serve as  object to verbs generally  requiring a prepositional object. Normally the ing-form  is used in this case. For the  list of verbs see Verbs 216. However after some verbs the ing-form  is inter - changeable with the infinitive. These verbs are to agree  to aim to care to hesi  tate to long to plan and to threaten.  e.g. I may as well plan on living in London for the rest of my life said George.  Everything youve planned to do is sensible.  He was still hesitating about joining the expedition.  They d idnt hesitate to make free use of his purse.  Note 4. There have been a great many attempts to explain the difference in the  use of the infinitive and the ing -form after the verbs given in this section. The in - finitive has been described as referring to special particular and concrete occasions  or circumstances as being more definite and lively in character and perfective in  aspect. Conversely the ing -form has been described as stating a general fact repre - senting an action as permanent or more abstr act expressing a deliberate act and  being imperfective in its aspect. However none of the above explanations are borne  out by living English usage. Moreover some of the authors believe that it is unnec - essary to make formal distinctions between the two  constructions.   238. As an object of an adjective the infinitive and the ing- iorm are lexically dependent. For the lists see Verbs  187  and 217. Both verbals may be found after the following adjec - tives and adjectivized participles afraid ama zed annoyed  ashamed astonished careful certain content fortunate fright - ened furious happy keen proud right scared set slow sorry  sure surprised touched and wrong. The ing form is always used as  a prepositional object after them.  On th e whole the choice between the infinitive and the ing- iorm after the above adjectives appears to be free.  Cf. I was touched to find my own name on the invitation list.  She couldnt allow herself to tell him how touched she was at  finding him there.  Her co at was pulled tightly round her as if she were afraid  to take it off.  Are you wanted by the police? You neednt be afraid of tell - ing me.  She is certain to get the names wrong. She is so careless.  You look for trouble dont you? Only because Im certa in of finding it.  I was just scared to leave it there.  I was scared to death at going there to speak.  She told me sternly how fortunate I was to be there in time.  I am very fortunate in having a wife who likes being a woman.  I was content to let things dr ift along just as they were.  I was fairly content with letting things go as they were.  She looked wonderfully and vividly alive and I was proud to be with her.  But when I went to Germany I discovered that the Germans  were just as proud of being Germans as  I was proud of be - ing English.  The men were careful not to slip on the ice.  We were never very careful about taking precautions.  After certain of the above adjectives however the infinitive  tends to express a single action following that of the predic ate verb a while the ing -form is preferred when simultaneous or  preceding actions are expressed b.  e.g. a In fact I havent the faintest idea whats been going on  and Im afraid to ask.  b Im always afraid of getting caught.  a I walked up and down t he hall. I was afraid to go in.  b Were you ever afraid of losing your mind?  a Well Im sorry to disappoint you but I wont be able to  use my car.  b Im sorry for coming like this without being invited.  a I thought that perhaps I should be wiser not to go.  b I thought she wasnt very wise in telling us that.  Yet it should be pointed out that on the whole the infinitive is  more common after all the above listed adjectives the ing -form is  somewhat literary in style.  The use of the infinitive and the ing -form w ith certain other  adjectives is associated with a change of meaning of the adjec - tive. Here belong for example grateful good interested and some others.  e.g. a The apples are good to eat the apples are good for eating  b Im not very good at driv ing I dont very well know how  to drive.  a At first he was grateful to have the play to read he was  pleased  happy to have....  b No one is grateful for being looked after no one feels  gratitude for being looked after.  a I was interested to lea rn that it was the same cafe where  they had met it was interesting for me to learn...  b Somehow I was interested in getting back into that work  I was anxious to get....  The Infinitive and the ing -form as Object  in a Sentence Pattern with it as a Fo rmal Subject   239. We usually find the infinitive as an object of a verb or  adjective in a sentence pattern with it as a formal subject.  e.g. It annoyed me to hear him tell a lie.  Its not easy to live with someone youve injured.  It wouldnt be tactful t o bring up the subject in his presence.  The ing -form can also be found as an object of an adjective in  a sentence pattern with it as a formal subject in spoken English  where it adds emotional colouring to the sentence.  e.g. Well it isnt easy telling you all this.  It will be great having them at the party.  However only the ing -form is used after the expressions to be  worth and to come to.  e.g. If it came to losing him would she suffer?  It wasnt worth talking to him about it.  The Infinitive and the ing-form  as Subjective Predicative   240. As subjective predicative the infinitive and the ing -form  are lexically dependent for the lists see Verbs  192 and 221.  Both verbals are found after the following verbs in the passive to find to hear to leav e to report to see to show and to watch.  After to hear to see and to watch the differentiation between  the two verbals is based on their lexical character. Both verbals  serve to express simultaneous actions. But with terminative  verbs the infinitive s hows that the action is accomplished a  whereas the ing -form denotes an unaccomplished action in its  Progress b.  e.g. a The front door downstairs was heard to slam.  He was seen to take the money.  b The door was heard shutting.  He was last seen turnin g round the corner.  With durative verbs the difference between the two verbals  disappears and the choice of the form is free.  e.g. He had been heard to discuss the possibility.  He went out and was heard laughing in the hall.  After the verbs to find to r eport and to show the difference be - tween the two verbals is of a peculiar character   with the verb to be the subjective predicative is always expressed by a simple infini - tive a with all other verbs it is expressed by an ing-form b. e.g. a A wee k later he was found to be out of danger.  The Senator was reported to be badly injured in the accident  b The man was found crawling about.  About that time a hurricane was reported moving out of  the Caribbean in our direction.  However analytical forms of  the infinitive may also be found  with verbs other than to be. e.g. She was found to have stolen the ring.  The building is reported to have been damaged in the air raid.  He was reported to be preparing an account of the incident.  After the verb to leave the infinitive shows that the action  follows that of the predicate verb a while the ing-form expresses  a simultaneous action b.  e.g. a The matter will be left to lie.  If things are left to run their usual course everything  will shape out by itself  b Cliff and Helena were left looking at each other.  Some writers claim that in life stories are not finished situa - tions are not rounded off and loose ends are left hanging.  The Infinitive and the ing-form as Objective Predicative   241. As objective pred icatives the infinitive and the ing -form  are lexically dependent for the lists see Verbs  193 and 222.  Both verbals are found after the following verbs to fancy to feel  to find to get to hate to have to hear to imagine to dislike to  listen to to notice to see to understand to want and to watch.  After the verbs denoting physical perception such as to feel to  hear to listen to to notice to see and to watch the choice between the  infinitive and the ing -form is determined by their l exical character  With terminative verbs the infinitive expresses an accomplished ac - tion a and the ing -form an unaccomplished action in its progress b - e.g. a Nobody had noticed him come in. Nobody had seen him go  upstairs.  b He heard footsteps coming from the direction of the library.  a Bridget heard Luke drive up. She came out on the steps to  meet him.  b As I looked out at the garden I heard a motor -truck start - ing on the road.  a One night in late November I heard him make a remark  about his coming marriage.  b I heard him saying the other day he could do with a few  more pounds a week.  With durative verbs the difference in meaning between the  two verbals disappears and the choice of the form is free.  e.g. a I thought also that it would do hi m no harm to hear us talk about his progress  b Ive never heard you talking like this about him.  a I was watching the doctor work.  b I noticed him working in the garden.   a They listened to him talk about the picture.  b I listened to them discussing it. On the w hole it should be pointed out that the ing -form is  more common in this case. The infinitive for example would not  be used in the following sentences  e.g. I held her close against me and could feel her heart beating.  We saw the troops marching along the road.  I looked in the door of the big room and saw the major sit- ting at his desk.  With the verbs to fancy to find to imagine and to under - stand the difference lies in the lexical character of the objective  predicative. With the verb to be the object ive predicative is al - ways an infinitive a with all other verbs it is an ing -form b.  e.g. a They found him to be a bore.  b When he arrived he found me reading Tom Jones.  a I imagined him to be a bigger man.  b I imagined her sitting by the fire -place alone and in tears.  After the verbs to get to hate to have to like and to want the choice between the infinitive and the ing -form is free. Yet the in - finitive is much more common with to get and to want whereas  the ing-form  is more common with to dislike and to hate.  e.g. a He wanted us to go with him but Jimmy refused.  b I didnt want any outsiders coming to the rehearsal.  a I couldnt get him to leave.  b She got all her guests going the moment she felt sleepy.   a I like my oatmeal to have a salty t aste.  b I dont like anybody getting ideas where my wife is concerned.  The Infinitive and the ing-form as Attribute   242. As attributes the infinitive and the ing-form overlap  only when they have appositive meaning. They are both placed in  post-position to their head -noun and are lexically dependent. For  the lists of nouns see Verbs  204 2 and 230. Besides the ing - form is always preceded by a preposition usually of. We may find either an infinitive or an ing -form after the fol - lowing nouns actio n attempt capacity chance excuse intention  motion necessity opportunity possibility power precaution right  sign and way. On the whole the choice between the two verbals af - ter these nouns is free.  e.g. a I havent had a chance to see my dog this morning.  b The Careys had had a chance of welcoming their nephew.  a He was trying to find a way to earn fifty pounds.  b They were trying to find a way of talking directly to their  opponents.  a I had no opportunity to speak to her.  b I had no opportunity of doing so.   a She only laughed and made no attempt to withdraw.  b I made another attempt at going.  It should be mentioned that some of the nouns quoted above for  example such an attempt necessity right tend to be associated will  an infinitive whereas other  nouns for example such as chance in  tention possibility way tend to be followed by an ing -form. The  noun opportunity appears to be equally common with both forms.  The Infinitive and the ing-form as Attribute  in a Sentence Pattern with it as a Forma l Subject   243. In this function the infinitive and the ing-form  are lexi - cally dependent. For the lists of the nouns see  206 231. The infinitive is the norm the ing -form being a rare exception.  e.g. It was a pleasure to see him among us again.  It is a hard job to clean the kitchen.  It is no use deceiving ourselves.   244. The use of the infinitive and the ing -form in all the oth - er functions is not parallel and so they need not be compared.  The Use of the Participle   245. The functions of the p articiple in the sentence are more  restricted as compared with those of the infinitive and the ing- iorm. Besides it tends to become adjectivized even in the func - tions that it can perform in the sentence. For the adjectivization  of the participle see  Verbs  179.  The participle cannot be used either as the subject or as the  predicate of the sentence. When it is used as predicative it is al - ways adjectivized and may be preceded like a real adjective by ad - verbs of degree such as extremely grea tly so too very and the  correlative conjunctions as ... as and not so ... as. e.g. Three of the girls were given to giggling.  Roger was set on getting the job himself.  Strickland was distinguished from most Englishmen by his  perfect indifference to comf ort. We lived in the same neighbourhood and we felt friendly dis - posed to one another.  I was cold but too excited to mind it.  Ive never been so deceived in a man as I was in George.  If anyone lived there he would be as scared as we were.  I am naturally very disappointed.  It should be mentioned that if participles were not adjectiv - ized in this case they would form with the verb to be the Pas - sive Voice.  Note. Some adjectivized participles however can be modified like verbs by  very much. This may be accounted for by their verbal origin.  e.g. If Tony expected her to rush into his arms he was very much mistaken.  In a day or two the answer came back that he was very much opposed to the  whole scheme.  It follows from what has been said that the part iciple proper i.e.  the participle which is not adjectivized cannot be used as predicative.  The Participle as Part of a Compound Verbal Predicate   246. One of the functions in which the participle proper is  used is part of a compound verbal predicate. T he participle is  lexically dependent in this function   it is found after the in - transitive verbs to lie to sit and to stand which denote position.  e.g. He stood surprised in front of his house.  The smoke drifted away and the camp lay revealed.  He was ly ing back relaxed in his chair.  Joe sat hunched in a corner of the seat.  Examples of this kind are of rare occurrence and the participle  may be adjectivized here too.  The Participle as a Second Action Accompanying  the Action of the Predicate Verb   247. The participle may express a second action accom - panying the action of the predicate verb. The second action is pas - sive in meaning and hence it shows that the person indicated by  the grammatical subject of the sentence undergoes the action de - noted by the participle.  With terminative verbs the participle in this function indi - cates an action that precedes the action of the predicate verb  e.g. Asked when they could expect an answer the clerk said it  would take them about a week.  Shocked by the povert y of my own vocabulary I went to the  British Museum library.   with durative verbs the participle expresses an action simul - taneous with that of the predicate verb  e.g. He stood there drinking tomato juice surrounded by people  absorbing the radiation  of his power.  Then I saw my mother. She sat by the window lighted up by  the setting sun.  The participle in this function may be found in different posi - tions in the sentence  e.g. Suddenly touched the girl came over to the side of his chair  and kissed his cheek.  I went out of the court determined to show them a good play.  This participle is characteristic of literary English.  The Participle as Subjective Predicative   248. The participle may be used as subjective predicative. It  is lexically dependent i n this function and is used after the pas - sive of the verbs to find to hear to see and to make.  e.g. Then he was found barricaded in a little hut.  A minute ago he was seen engaged in a lively conversation  with a charming girl.  Note. To be made known is treated as a set phrase.  e.g. Im afraid this information will have to be made known.  Examples of this kind are of rare occurrence and the participle  is often adjectivized.  The Participle as Objective Predicative   249. The participle is also used as objec tive predicative. It is  lexically dependent in this function and found after a number of  transitive verbs followed by a direct object which is expressed by  a noun or a pronoun. These verbs are to believe to consider to  feel to find to get to have to  hear to keep to leave to like to  make to see to think to want to watch and the set phrases  wont like wont have and shouldwould like.  e.g. On arriving at the cottage she found it locked.  Despite himself Maurice felt his attention caught.  You ll never guess where I had the suit made.  But even if you work hard it takes a long time to write a nov - el. And you have to get it published.  I said I had not heard the matter mentioned.  I want it proved he roared.  I would like it done right away.  The passive subject of the participle in this function is the  object of the sentence see also Verbs  174.  The Participle as Adverbial Modifier   250. The participle may serve as adverbial modifier of a  verb. In this function it denotes a second action accompanying the  action of the predicate verb. In this case it is preceded by a con- junction which lends it adverbial meaning such as time conces - sion condition and comparison. The most commonly occurring of  the conjunctions are when till until onc e as if unless  though as though even if and even when.  The participle is not lexically dependent in this function   it can be used after any verb.  e.g. Shes a terror when roused.  Once arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transat - lantic l iner the detective became brisk and alert.  Soames privately and as a businessman had always so con - ducted himself that if cornered he need never tell a direct  untruth.  He did not usually utter a word unless spoken to.  He had till Sunday evening to th ink it over for even if post - ed now the letter could not reach John till Monday.  Here the tram lines ended so that men returning home could  doze in their seats until roused by their journeys end.  Does he know it? said David Rubin as though surprised . The subject of the action expressed by the participle in the  above function is the same person or thing as denoted by the sub - ject of the sentence.  Note 1. Notice the set phrase come to that            . e.g. But who is to  be the judge of a mans fitness or unfitness? Youd have to  have a scientific man as judge. Come to that I think youd be a pretty good  judge yourself.  Note 2. Some participles have actually come to be used as conjunctions.  e.g. Roger could be re -elected provided he received the 290 votes from his own side.   251. The participle may be part of an absolute construction. In  this case it has a subject of its own. The participle serves to indicate  a resultant state which is parallel to the action of the pr edicate verb.  Absolute constructions may be non -prepositional and preposi - tional. In the latter case they are introduced by the preposition with.  The main function of the absolute construction with the parti - ciple is to describe the appearance behaviour  or inner state of the  person denoted by the subject of the sentence. In other words it  serves as an adverbial modifier of descriptive circumstances. This function can be performed by absolute constructions non -preposi - tional a and prepositional b.  e.g. a In the library Diana her face flushed talked to a young  dramatist.  We sat silent her eyes still fixed on mine.  She got up the clothes folded over her arm.  b She stood with her arms folded smoking staring thought - fully.  He sat with his knees  parted turning his wrists vaguely.  I lay idly in a big chair talking now and then listening  listening sometimes with my eyes closed.  A peculiar feature of non -prepositional absolute constructions  with the participle is that sometimes the nouns in them are used  without any article.  e.g. She advanced two more strides and waited head half turned.  The President listened to her standing at the fire -place head  bowed motionless.  Joel sat scrunched in a corner of the seat elbow propped on window frame chin cupped in hand trying hard to keep  awake.  Absolute constructions with the participle are usually found  in literary style.  Note. Notice the set phrase all things considered.  e.g. All things considered there is little hope of their withdrawal.  The Parti ciple as Attribute   252. There are two types of attributes expressed by the par - ticiple  1 the participle may immediately precede its head -noun  2 the participle may follow its head -noun and be separated from  the noun by a pause i.e. the participle is a loo se attribute here.1 Attributes expressed by participles are not lexically dependent  they can modify any noun.   253. When the participle immediately precedes its head -noun  it is always a single word not an extended phrase.  With transitive verbs the part iciple has passive meaning   it serves to show that the person or thing denoted by the head -noun  undergoes the action expressed by the participle. The head -noun is  the passive subject of the participle here.  e.g. A man in torn and dusty clothes was making his way towards  the boat.  This forlorn creature with the dyed hair and haggard paint - ed face would have to know the truth he decided. I made  my way forward the parked car. Why dont you stop torturing yourself and put an end to all  this wasted effort o n your part? she would tell me.  In the building lighted windows were shining here and there.  In the examples above we are dealing with real participles  which preserve their verbal character and denote actions. Howev - er participles in this function are often adjectivized which is  clearly seen from their changed meaning.  e.g. She had an affected absent way of talking.  After a moment she opened the door and got in with a grieved  expression.  1 Loose corresponds to the Russian  . When I was eighteen I had very decided views of my own  about my future.  With intransitive verbs 1 the participle has active meaning  it serves to show that the person or thing denoted by the head - noun is the doer of the action expressed b y the participle. The  head -noun is the active subject of the participle here.  e.g. They sat on a fallen tree that made a convenient seat.  Jenkinson was a retired colonel who lived in Dorset and whose  chief occupation was gardening.  Other examples of this k ind are the risen sun the departed  guest the assembled company his deceased partner.  Participles as attributes preceding their head -nouns are in com - mon use in English they are not restricted stylistically.  Note 1. It should be noted that the particip les involved added obtained and combined are placed in post -position to their head -words.  e.g. I did not want to go to a club for lunch in case I met Douglas or anyone in- volved.  We could not resist all of these people combined.  Note 2. The participle left in post -position undergoes a change of meaning and  its use becomes structurally restricted. It is found in two constructions it modifies  nouns or pronouns in sentences with there is are and in sentences with the verb to have. Left in such sentenc es is rendered in Russian with the help of  . e.g. There was no evidence left.  Hes the only friend I seem to have left now.  Its just all we seem to have left.   254. The participle as a loose attribute is usually part of an ex - tended phrase. As a  general rule it follows its head -noun. The noun  may perform any function in the sentence. The participle in this  case is formed from a transitive verb and has passive meaning.  e.g. Mr Johnson I have sent for you to tell you of a serious com - plaint sent  in to me from the court.  He carried the crate out to the Ford truck parked in the nar - row alley behind the store.  As has been said see Verbs  173 there are not many participles formed from  transitive verbs.  The passive subject of the participl e in this function is its  head -noun see also Verbs 174.  e.g. Lennox sat down on a chair lately vacated by Lady Westholme.  I rode about the countryside on a horse lent me by a friend.  In a considerable number of instances the participle is adjec - tivized in this case  e.g. The men ran out of the house like schoolboys frightened of  being late.  Police are looking for a boy known to work at Turtles.  They elected a man called G. S. Clark.  The participle as a loose attribute is typical of literary style.  It is not found in spoken English.  NOUNS   1. Nouns are names of objects i.e. things human beings ani - mals materials and abstract notions e.g. table house man girl  dog lion snow sugar love beauty.  Semantically all nouns can be divided into  two main groups  proper names e.g. John London the Thames and common nouns.  Common nouns in their turn are subdivided into countable  nouns and uncountable nouns. Countable nouns denote objects  that can be counted. They may be either concrete e.g. book stu - dent cat or abstract e.g. idea word effort. Uncountable nouns  are names of objects that cannot be counted. They may also be con - crete e.g. water grass wood and abstract e.g. information  amazement time.  Nouns have the grammatical ca tegories of number and case  see Nouns  3-19. They are also characterized by the functions they perform in  the sentence see Nouns  20.  The Gender of Nouns   2. In accordance with their meaning nouns my be classed as  belonging to the masculine feminine and neuter gender. Names of  male beings are masculine e.g. man husband boy son ox cock  and names of female beings are feminine e.g. woman wife girl  daughter cow hen. All other nouns are said to be neuter e.g.  pen flower family r ain opinion bird horse pride. Gender finds  its formal expression in the replacement of nouns by the pronouns  he   she or it. However there are nouns in English which may be treated as  either males or females e.g. cousin friend. They are said to be  of common gender. When there is no need to make a distinction of  sex the masculine pronoun is used for these nouns.  Sometimes a separate form for a female is built up by means of  the suffix -ess e.g. host  hostess actor   actress waiter  waitress prince   princess heir   heiress tiger   tigress lion  lioness.  It is also possible to indicate the gender of a noun by forming  different kinds of compounds e.g. a man servant   a maid ser - vant a man driver   a woman driver a boy -friend   a girl - friend a tom -cat  a tabby -cat a he -wolf  a she -wolf.  Nouns denoting various kinds of vessels e.g. ship boat etc.  the noun car as well as the names of countries may be referred to  as she. e.g. Sam joined the famous whaler Globe.  She was a ship on which any young man would be proud to sail.  Getting out of the car he said to the man in the overalls Fill  her up please.  He said England is decadent. Shes finished because she is living in the past.  The Number of Nouns   3. Number is the form o f the noun which shows whether one  or more than one object is meant. Some nouns in English may have  the singular and the plural forms e.g. room   rooms worker  workers lesson   lessons. Other nouns are used either only in the  singular e.g. freedom p rogress machinery steel milk or only in  the plural e.g. spectacles goods billiards.   4. The plural of most nouns is built up by means of the suffix  -s or -es. It is pronounced z after vowels and voiced consonants  e.g. days dogs birds s after voiceless consonants e.g. books  coats and iz after sibilants e.g. horses roses judges brushes.  It should be noted that some nouns in the plural change the pro - nunciation of their final consonants s - ziz e.g. house   hous - es and  - Sz e.g. bath   baths mouth   mouths path  paths truth   truths youth   youths.   5. In writing the following spelling rules should be observed  The suffix es is added to nouns ending in s sh ch x and z e.g- glass   glasses brush   brushe s watch   watches box   boxes.  It is also added to nouns ending in  preceded by a consonant  e.g. tomato   tomatoes potato   potatoes hero   heroes. But if  a noun ends in  preceded by a vowel or it happens to be a noun of     foreign origin only -s is added e.g. cuckoo   cuckoos radio   radios piano   pianos kil o  kilos photo   photos.  Nouns ending in -y preceded by a consonant change the -y into -ies e.g. story   stories fly   flies country   countries.  But if a noun ends in -y preceded by a vowel only -s is added  e.g. key  keys boy  boys day   days . The following nouns ending in -f or -fe have the ending -ves in the plural  wife   wives life   lives knife   knives wolf  wolves calf   calves shelf   shelves leaf   leaves thief  thieves half   halves.  But other nouns ending in -f or -fe take only -s in the plural  e.g. roof   roofs cliff   cliffs gulf   gulfs proof   proofs  safe  safes grief   griefs cuff   cuffs belief   beliefs.  The following nouns have both forms in the plural scarf  scarfsscarves wharf   wharfswharves hoo f  hoofshooves  handkerchief   handkerchiefshandkerchieves.   6. There are a number of nouns in English which form their   plural in an irregular way.  A few nouns form their plural by a change of vowel. They are  man   men woman   women tooth   teeth foot  feet   mouse   mice goose   geese louse   lice.  Note also the peculiar plural form in the nouns ox  oxen  child   children brother   brethren not blood relations but  members of the same society.  A few nouns have the same form for the singul ar and the plural  a sheep   sheep a swine   swine a deer   deer a fish   fish a  craft   craft a counsel   counsel legal adviser barrister.  The following nouns ending in s in the singular remain un - changed in the plural a means   means a gas works   gas  works a barracks   barracks a headquarters   headquarters a  series   series a species   species.  Note. Note that the noun penny has two plural forms pennies when referring  to individual coins and pence when the amount only is meant.  e.g. She dropped three pennies in the slot -machine.  The fare cost him eight pence.   7. Some nouns borrowed from other languages especially  from Greek and Latin keep their foreign plural forms. These  nouns are mostly found in scientific prose. They are agendum  agenda analysis   analyses bacterium   bacteria basis  bases crisis   crises criterion   criteria datum   data hy  pothesis   hypotheses phenomenon   phenomena stratum  strata thesis   theses.  Some other nouns have the new English plur al alongside of the  original foreign one curriculum   curriculumscurricula formula  formulas formulae memorandum   memorandumsmemoranda.   8. With compound nouns it is usually the final component  that is made plural e.g. bookcase   bookcases writi ng table  writing tables tooth brush   tooth brushes handful   handfuls  drawback   drawbacks forget -me-not  forget -me-nots post  man  postmen Englishman   Englishmen.  In. a few nouns the first component is made plural e.g. father - in-law  father s-in-law commander -in-chief   commanders -in- chief passer -by  passers by.  When the first component is man or woman the plural is ex - pressed twice e.g. man servant   men servants woman doctor  women doctors.   9. A considerable number of nouns are  used only in the singu - lar in English. The Latin term singularia tantum is applied to  them. Here belong all names of materials e.g. iron copper sand  coal bread cheese oil wine tea chalk and also a great number  of nouns denoting abstract noti ons 1 e.g. generosity curiosity an - ger foolishness excitement poetry fun sculpture progress.  Special mention should be made of a few nouns which end in -s but are used only in the singular. They are news gallows sum - mons.  Here also belong no uns ending in -ics physics mathematics  phonetics optics ethics politics.  Note. Nouns of the latter group are occasionally treated as plurals.  e.g- Politics has have always interested him.  Mathematics is are well taught at that school.  1 Note how ever that many other abstract nouns may have both the singular and  the plural forms e.g. idea  ideas change   changes suggestion   suggestions.   10. There are a few nouns in English which are used only in  the plural. The Latin term pluralia tantum  is applied to them.  Here belong nouns indicating articles of dress consisting of two  parts e.g. trousers pants shorts trunks pyjamas drawers brac - es tools and instruments consisting of two parts e.g. scissors  spectacles glasses tongs pince rs scales fetters names of some  games e.g.  billiards  cards dominoes draughts and also miscella - neous other nouns e.g. riches contents dregs oats thanks  clothes credentials soap -suds troops goods whereabouts bowels  surroundings savin gs belongings goings on winnings home -com- ings proceedings hangings.  e.g. The whereabouts of the tomb have long been an historic mys - tery.  There were clothes scattered about the room.   ll. There are a few other nouns in English which have only  the plural form and lack the singular i.e. pluralia tantum nouns.  But they happen to be homonyms of nouns which are used in both  forms the singular and the plural. These nouns are  a colour   colours hues  a force   forces powers  a custom   customs habits  a draught   draughts cur - rents of air  a glass   glasses vessels  for drinking from  a manner   manners ways  a moral   morals lessons  of a story  a minute   minutes spaces  of time  a quarter   quarters fourth  parts   12. Some nouns which belong t o the singularia tantum group  are occasionally used in the plural form for stylistic reasons sug - gesting a great quantity or extent e.g. the sands of the Sahara  the snows and frosts of the Arctic the waters of the Atlantic the  blue skies of Italy etc. colours regimental flags  forces an army  customs taxes on imported  goods  draughts a game  glasses spectacles  manners behaviour  morals standards of behav - iour  minutes secretarys record  of proceedings  quarters lodgings   13. A noun used as subject of the sentence agrees in number  with its predicate verb a singular noun takes a singular verb a  plural noun takes a plural verb. This rule may be called grammati - cal concord.  e.g. If we ever thought nature was simple no w we know for sure  it isnt.  If there are any universal laws for the cosmos they must be  very difficult.  Difficulties arise however with collective nouns i.e. nouns  denoting groups of people and sometimes animals. Here belong  such nouns as the aristocr acy army audience board the bourgeoi  sie class the clergy committee the Congress crew crowd dele - gation the elite family flock the gentry government group herd  the intelligentsia jury majority minority Parliament the prole - taria t the public staff team etc. Such nouns may be used in two ways they either indicate the  group as a single undivided body a non -personal collective or as a  collection of individuals. In the former case there is no contradic - tion between the form an d the meaning of such nouns and they  take a singular noun grammatical concord.  e.g. The audience was enormous.  The crowd has been dispersed.  The public consists of you and me.  The college football team has done badly this season.  His family was well know n in their town.  In the latter case the nouns though remaining singular gram - matically become plural notionally and take a plural verb. This  may be called notional concord.  e.g. The public were not admitted to hear the trial.  The team are now resting the coach said to us.  My family keep a close eye on me said George.  The audience were enjoying every minute of it.  Some of the collective nouns however regularly require a plu - ral verb. Here belong people    1  police and cattle.  1 The noun people meaning nationality can have a singular and a plural form a  people   peoples.  e.g. There were few people out in the street at that hour.  He said Martha the police have the man that stole your  purse. His uncle showed him the pastures where the cattle were  grazing.  On the whole in British English the plural verb appears to be  more common with collective nouns in speech whereas in writing  the singular verb is probably preferred. It is generally saf est for a  foreign learner when in doubt to obey grammatical concord. In  American English collective nouns almost always go with a singu - lar verb.  Note. A number of    usually agrees with a plural verb.  e.g. There were quite a number of people watching the game.  The Case of Nouns   14. Case is the form of the noun which shows the relation of  the noun to other words in the sentence.  English nouns have two case forms   the common case and  the genitive case e.g. the child   the childs father an hour  an hours walk.   15. The genitive case is formed by means of the suffix -s or the apostrophe - alone.  The suffix -s is pronounced z after vowels and vo iced conso - nants e.g. boys girls s after voiceless consonants e.g. stu- dents wifes iz after sibilants e.g. princes judges.  The -s is added to singular nouns see the examples above and  also to irregular plural nouns e.g. mens child rens womens.  The apostrophe - alone is added to regular plural nouns e.g.  soldiers parents workers and also to proper names ending in -s e.g. Archimedes Law Sophocles plays Hercules labours.  Some other proper names ending in -s may also take the suffix -s e.g. Soames Soamess collection Burns Burnss poems Dick - ens Dickenss novels Jones Joness car etc. The common  pronunciation of both variants appears to be ...iz but the com - mon spelling   with the apostrophe only . Note. Notice that with compound nouns the suffix s is always added to the fi - nal component e.g. my father in laws house the passerbys remark.   16. The number of nouns which may be used in the genitive  case is limited. The -s genitive commonly oc curs with animate  nouns denoting personal names Johns bed Marys job Segovias  pupil etc. personal nouns my friends visit the boys new shirt  the mans question etc. collective nouns the partys platform  the teams victory the governments  policy etc. and higher ani - mals the dogs barking the lions cage etc..  In principle the -s genitive is also possible with certain kinds  of inanimate nouns and abstract notions. For example it is regu - larly found with temporal nouns a days wo rk a few days trip a  two years absence a moments pause a seven months pay etc.  and with nouns denoting distance and measure a miles distance  a shillings worth etc.. Sometimes it is used with geographic  names of continents countries cities  towns and universities Eu - ropes future the United States policy Londons water supply  etc. locative nouns the islands outline the citys white houses  the schools history etc. as well as a few other nouns the suns  rays the ships crew  the plays title Natures sleep etc..  There are also a considerable number of set phrases in which  all sorts of nouns are found in the genitive case e.g. in ones  minds eye a pins head to ones hearts content at ones fingers  end for goodness  sake at ones wits end out of harms way du - tys call a needles point.   17. A noun in the genitive case generally precedes another  noun which is its head -word. This may be called the dependent  genitive.  The relations between the noun in the geniti ve case and its  head -word may be of two kinds  1 The noun in the genitive case may denote a particular per - son or thing as in my mothers room the mans voice. This kind  of the genitive case is called the specifying genitive. The more  common meanings o f the specifying genitive are the following  a possession  e.g. Marys suitcase Mary has a suitcase  the childrens toys the children have toys  b subjective genitive  e.g. that boys answer the boy answered  the parents consent the parents con sented  c genitive of origin  e.g. the girls story the girl told the story  the generals letter the general wrote the letter  d objective genitive  e.g. the boys punishment somebody punished the boy  the mans release somebody released the man  The specifying genitive may be replaced if necessary by an of- phrase e.g. the father of the boys the room of my brother who is in  hospital etc. With proper names however the genitive case is the  rule e.g. Johns parents Marys birthday Byrons f irst poems.  Note. There is considerable overlap in the uses of the -s genitive and the of- phrase. Although either of the two may be possible in a given context only one of  them is however generally preferred for reasons of structure euphony rhythm  emphasis or implied relationship between the nouns. The use of the -s genitive is  very common in headlines where brevity is essential. Furthermore the -s genitive  gives prominence to the modifying noun. Compare  Hollywoods Studios Empty  The Studios o f Hollywood Empty  2 The noun in the genitive case may refer to a whole class of  similar objects. This kind of the genitive case is called the classify - ing descriptive genitive e.g. sheeps eyes which means eyes of a  certain kind but not the eyes o f a particular sheep a doctors de - gree a doctoral degree cows milk milk from cows a wom - ens college a college for women a soldiers uniform a sum - mers day a dolls face a planters life gents clothes ladys  wear an hours walk a miles distance etc. In some cases such combinations have become set phrases e.g.  a spiders web the serpents tooth the bees sting a giants task a  fools errand a cats paw       -   childs play and others.  The classifying genitive is generally not replaced by an of- phrase except for the genitive indicating time and distance.  e.g. a three days absence  an absence of three days  a two miles distanc e - a distance of two miles   18. The suffix -s may be added not only to a single noun but  to a whole group of words. It is called the group genitive. We find  various patterns here e. g. Smith and Browns office Jack and  Anns children the Prime Mini ster of Englands residence the  Prince of Denmarks tragedy somebody elses umbrella the man  we saw yesterdays son.   19. Sometimes we find the use of -s and of together. This is  called a double genitive.  e.g. He was an old business client of Grandfat hers one of  Grandfathers clients.   20. A noun in the genitive case may be used without a head - word. This is called the independent genitive.  The independent genitive is used with nouns denoting trade  and relationship or with proper names. It serves to denote a build - ing e.g. a school a house a hospital a church or a shop. It is  mainly found in prepositional phrases.  e.g. I was in the grocers and I heard some women say it.  He asked her how she liked living at her daughters.  They were married a t St. Pauls.  Mrs White ran the confectioners very competently.  He asked her to choose a restaurant and she suggested Scotts.  The Functions of Nouns in the Sentence   21. Nouns may have different functions in the sentence. They  may serve as  1 the subje ct e.g. Life consists in accepting ones duty.  2 an object direct indirect and prepositional  e.g. You did such splendid work.  General Drake handed the man his medal.  He wont listen to any advice.  3 a predicative non -prepositional and prepositional  e.g. The town has always been a quiet and dignified little place.  The place was in disorder.  4 an objective predicative  e.g. They elected him president of the club.  5 a subjective predicative  e.g. He was appointed squadron commander.  6 various adv erbial modifiers usually as part of prepositional  phrases  e.g. I lived near Victoria station in those years.  He spoke in a different tone.  7 an attribute in the genitive case in the common case and as  part of prepositional phrases  e.g. His officer s uniform gave slimness to his already heavy fig - ure. For some time he read all the travel books he could lay his  hands on.  He set off on a tour of inspection.  8 an apposition  e.g. He told us about his father a teacher who died in the war.  The follow ing classification seems to be suitable for the purpose   ARTICLES   1. The article is a structural word specifying the noun. The  absence of the article which may be called the zero article also specifies the noun and has significance. J There are two articles in English which are called the definite  and the indefinite article.  The use of articles as well as their absence has grammatical  meaning and follows certain rules. There are cases however in  which the use of articles cannot be accounted for g rammatically  as it has become a matter of tradition. This is found in numerous  set phrases as in at night   in the night in the distance   at a distance as a result of   under the influence of to take the trou  ble  to take care of to be in danger   to be in a rage etc. The traditional use of articles is also found in other cases. For  example names of countries are generally used without any article  but the names of certain countries or regions owing to a well -es- tablished tradition are associate d with the definite article e.g. the Crimea the Caucasus the Congo the Sudan the Tyrol the Ruhr  and some others.  Thus in dealing with the use of articles it will be necessary to  divide all the cases into two groups which may be called the gram - matical use of articles and the traditional use of articles.  The grammatical use of articles is dependent on the character  of the noun.  In order to describe the use of articles we need some classi - fication of nouns upon which our description will be based.  1 The absence of the article is not to be confused with the deliberate omission of  the article for stylistic reasons as seen in newspaper headings stage directions tele - grams etc.  e.g. Newspaper headlines Biggest Brain Drain Source in Britain  Fight ove r Market  Stage remarks Catherine enters from kitchen crosses down to window  looks out.  Note. Nouns denoting unique objects e.g. the sun the moon or unique notions  e.g. the past the plural are neither countable nor uncountable.  As is seen from th e above table proper names form a special  category and the use of articles with them should be treated sepa - rately. With common nouns the use of articles is dependent on  whether a noun is countable or uncountable.  THE FUNCTIONS OF ARTICLES WITH COMMON N OUNS  The Indefinite Article   2. With countable nouns both concrete and abstract the in - definite article is used when we wish to name an object a thing a  person an animal or an abstract notion to state what kind of ob - ject is meant.  e.g. He gave h er a cigarette and lighted it.  There came a tap at the door and a small elderly man en- tered the room wearing a black cap.  This function may be called the nominating function.  But at the same time owing to its origin from the numeral  one the indefinit e article always implies the idea of oneness and is  used only before nouns in the singular.  The idea of oneness may sometimes become quite prominent. It  occurs in the following cases  a a hundred a thousand a minute a mile etc. b after the negative not  not a word not a trace not a  thought etc. c in some set phrases   one at a time at a draught as in  He emptied his glass at a draught a stitch in time saves nine  etc.  3. When the speaker uses the indefinite article he just  names an object which  is usually new to the hearer. So the indefi - nite article is often used to introduce a new element in the sen - tence. Since the new element is as a rule important and attracts  attention the noun with the indefinite article frequently becomes  the centre  of communication and is marked by strong stress.  e.g. I think he is a stupid fellow.  Presently the Browns arrived. They brought with them a  small child a governess and a dog.  The table was covered with a white cloth.  In contrast to this the definite art icle usually indicates that a  definite object is meant and that it is not new to the hearer. That  is why it often serves to show that the noun is not the centre of  communication. Compare the following sentences  e.g. I bought a book yesterday.  I bought the  book yesterday.  From the first sentence the hearer learns what object was bought yesterday. So a book is the new element in the sentence.  From the second sentence the hearer learns when the book was  bought he already knows that the speaker bought a book . In this  case the book is not the centre of communication.  In the Russian language which has no article the centre of  communication is usually marked by word -order and also stress.  Cf.    .     .         .        .  This distinction between the two articles is very helpful in  most cases but the rule does not always hold good. We may find  sentences in  which a noun with an indefinite article does not serve  as the centre of communication and is not marked by strong stress   a and vice versa a noun with the definite article marked by  strong stress may become the most important element of communi - cation b.  e.g. a A camel can carry heavy loads  b Shut the door he ordered.  It follows from the above examples that the use of the indefi - nite article with nouns serving as the centre of communication is  i   to be regarded as an additional rule.   4. With uncountable nouns the indefinite article serves to  bring out a special aspect of the notion expressed by the noun. In  this case its function may be called aspective.  e.g. A dull burning anger rose in his chest.  He had almost a supernatural courage.  In this case the noun is usually qualified by an attribute which  also brings out a special aspect. In its aspective function the indef - inite article is devoid of the idea of oneness.  The Definite Article   5. When used with countable nouns either concrete or ab - stract the definite article has two distinct functions  1 It may be used with singular and plural nouns to show that  the noun denotes a particular object a thing a person an animal  or an abstract notion or a group of objects as distinct from t he others of the same kind. In other words the definite article serves  to single out an object or several objects from all the other objects  of the same class. This function is called the individualizing func - tion of the definite article.  e.g. The car st opped. Paul got out and stretched himself.  As we stood on the steps we felt the smell of fallen leaves  coming from the garden.  Margot took up the telephone.  A boy rushed into the room.  The boy rushed into the room.  They were s ent to a conference  in May.  They were sent to the conference  in May. 2 The definite article may also have the generic function with countable nouns. With nouns in th e singular it serves to indicate  that the noun becomes a composite image of the class.  e.g. The tiger has always had the reputation of being a man -eater.  The linguist is interested in the form and meaning of all pos - sible statements in a language.  6. With uncountable nouns the function of the definite arti - cle may be called restricting.  The definite article restricts the material denoted by a concrete  uncountable noun to a definite quantity portion or to a definite  locality a it also restricts the a bstract notion expressed by an  uncountable noun to a particular instance b.  e.g. a He slowly pulled on his gloves concentrating on each fold  in the leather.  As we came out into the cold damp air she shivered  b The work seemed to consist chiefly of i nterviewing young  women for jobs in department stores.  I did not wish to betray the anxiety I felt.  Absence of the Article  the Zero Article   7. The absence of the article the zero article has only one  function with common nouns   the nominating functi on. This function of the zero article may be found with countable  nouns in the plural it is parallel to the use of the indefinite arti - cle with singular countable nouns. But while the indefinite article  is associated with the idea of oneness the zero ar ticle always im - plies more -than-oneness.  e.g. Marion came round the corner of the house wearing garden - ing gloves and a very old skirt.  My mother gave me some pennies to buy apples or a magazine.  She had a splitting headache and took an aspirin and sleep- ing pills.  The nominating function of the zero article is also found with  uncountable nouns both abstract and concrete names of materials.  e.g. Last night I felt friendship and sympathy for Henry but to - day he has become an enemy.  Life goes on ch angeless and ever changing.  Winterbourne asked for water and drank thirstily.  THE USE OF ARTICLES WITH COUNTABLE NOUNS  General Rules for the Use of Articles  with Countable Nouns   8. Countable nouns in the singular may be used with the in - definite article  in its nominating function and with the definite ar  ticle in its individualizing function.  e.g. They couldnt travel without a car there.  While her suit -case was being taken out of the car she looked  round.  He shut the door behind his wife and handed me a cigar.  I didnt enjoy the cigar because it was damp.  In the plural countable nouns may be used without any article  . or with the definite article. The absence of the article has nominat - ing force and the definite article is used in its individualizing  function.  e.g. They couldnt travel without cars there.  While their suit -cases were being taken out of the cars they  looked round.  He shut the door behind his wife and handed us cigars.  We didnt enjoy the cigars because they were damp.  Note. Note the use  of the noun things in the meaning circumstances condi - tions events in general the present state of affairs. It is used without any ar- ticle in this meaning.  e.g. Your refusal will only make things worse.  Things arent going very well at the f irm. I told him that youve let things slide for long enough.  Your father is making a mess of things.  You take things too seriously.  I must think things over.   9. Since the choice of articles is determined by the context or  the general situation we shou ld take into consideration attributes  modifying the noun as they constitute part of the context. At - tributes are generally divided into two classes limiting and de- scriptive.  A limiting attribute indicates such a quality or characteristic  of an object  or a group of objects which makes it distinct from  all other objects of the class.  e.g. She lost her temper Its the most unpleasant thing youve  ever told me.  She sat listening but the sound of her pounding heart covered  any other sound.  Alice smiled to him and took the letter he held out to her.  A descriptive attribute is used to describe an object or a group  of objects or give additional information about it. This kind of at - tribute does not single out an object or a group of objects but  only na rrows the class to which it belongs.  e.g. He wrote a novel.  He wrote a good novel.  He wrote a good historical novel.  In the above examples a good novel belongs to a narrower class  than a novel and a good historical novel belongs to a still narrow - er clas s. We find the same in  e.g. He smiled at the girl as she came down the stairs wearing a  red raincoat with a hood.  To the left there was a long room with a narrow table strewn  with periodicals.  Nouns modified by limiting attributes are used with the def - inite article.  Nouns modified by descriptive attributes may be used with ei - ther the indefinite or the definite articles as the choice of articles  for countable nouns is not affected by this kind of attribute.  But the division of attributes into two class es is not very helpful  for practical purposes since most attributes are not limiting or de - scriptive by nature. Taken by themselves they are neutral and it is  only in the context that they acquire limiting or descriptive force.  e.g. He was going to bu ild a new house.  Shortly after he moved to the new house he fell ill.  We shall take a road going through the forest as it wont be  so hot there.  We shall take the road going through the forest as it is a  short cut.  The above examples show that attributes as such cannot gen - erally be regarded as reliable criteria for the choice of articles.  Nevertheless we find a number of attributes which are distinct - ly limiting owing to their form of expression. In order to set them  apart we must survey the use of art icles with countable nouns  modified by all types of attributes.   10. The use of articles with countable nouns modified by ad - jectives. Attributes expressed by adjectives are usually descrip - tive.  She drove an old car. His office was in a fine gay busy  little street.  As was stated above descriptive attributes do not affect the  lice of articles. Thus we may find a noun modified by a descrip - attribute used with the definite article.  The woman looked at me shrewdly and there was a glint of hu - mour in the dark eyes.  We lay lazily on the steep bank looking at the tall reeds.  The definite article in this case is accounted for by the situa - tion but not by the attribute.  Note. The adjective pronouns all and whole are to be treated as descriptive at - tributes. The use of articles with nouns modified by these attributes is determined  by the situation.  All children like ice -cream.  All the children watched the game with excitement.  He never stayed a whole evening with us.  He spent the whole evening watching the telly.  The adjective pronoun such is also a descriptive attribute but unlike all and whole it is never combined with the definite article.  Your father is such a handsome man.  Im not prepared to believe such things about my son.  But adjectives may beco me limiting attributes when contrast  is implied - In this case they are marked by stronger stress.  e.g. Will you pack my things for me? I want the little suit -case  as Ill be away only one night.  She saw a car pull up at the curb with two women in it.  The y ounger woman asked her the way to the railway station.  Adjectives in the superlative degree however are always limit - ing attributes.  e.g. She was the smartest girl in the room.  The most dangerous person of all is my uncle the young  man whispered.  Note 1. Compare the following sentences.  e.g. Hes the most experienced doctor I know.  Hes a most experienced doctor.  In the first sentence we find the superlative degree of experienced which ac - counts for the use of the definite article. In this combinatio n both most and expert  enced are stressed. In the second sentence most is an adverb of degree     so the whole combination is a descriptive attribute and most is unstressed here.  Note 2. The combination a best suit     and a best seller      are set phrases.  Some adjectives adjective pronouns and adj ectivized toff-forms  almost always serve as limiting attributes. The most important of  them are right        and wrong    very only main principal central left and right  same coming following present former    and latter   . e.g. It just seems to be the wrong way to go about it.  My chief is the right man in the right place.  The questions you ask are the very questions I am putting  myself.  My mother was the only person whom I told what had hap- pened.  My relatives take a very grave view of the present situation.  Besides there are other adjectives which commonly though  not always serve as limiting attributes e.g. proper  -     adjacent alleged lower necessary  op- posite previous so -called upper usual and some others.  Note 1. An only child is a set phrase       . i    e.g. She is as spoiled as if she were an only child.  But we say She was the only child present in the drawing  room.  Note 2. Nouns m odified by the adjectives next and last are generally  used with the definite article.  e.g. We shall probably eat at the next table to him.  My father had not read the last seven pages of the book.  But when these adjectives modify nouns  denoting time actually coming or just past from the point of view of the speaker there is no article at all.  e.g. He said No you cant see her. She went to London last week  He said I am determined not to spend more than ten pounds on my clothes  next year and so Ill manage by myself.  It must be noted that in narration there is a fluctuation in the use of articles  with nouns modified by next. We find either the definite article or no article at all.  e.g. We had not been sitting long in the drawing -room before Mr March was ar - ranging a timetable for the next day.  I sent her a wire and she met me at the station next day.  Note 3. Note the difference in the use of articles with nouns modified by the  adjective pronoun other. The definite article is used  with a singular noun modified  by other if there are only two objects of the same description.  e.g He pulled on the other glove and said he would run along to his office.  If there are more than two objects of the same description the indefinite arti - cle is used another. In this case another has three meanings        and     . e.g. Could I have another cup of tea?  You can do as well as another man he said.  When I came back I found him in another mood.  The definite article is used with a plural noun modified by other if there is a definite number of objects divided into two definite groups.  e.g. Of the three people invited by her for the weekend one had already arrived.  Her husband wanted to know when the other guests were expected.  My mother needed me more than the other memb ers of the family.  In this case the other guests the other members etc. means the rest.  If some objects are divided into two groups and either one of the groups or  both of them are indefinite there is no article.  e.g. I was thinking of other people in  the same position.  Her brothers as a rule could not make themselves good friends to other men.  In this case other people other men etc. means  . The same rules are applied to other when it is used as a noun pronoun.  e.g. He drove with one hand  and used the other to draw diagrams in the air.  Young Martin was first sent on an errand to the grocer then on another to the  butcher.  Then Katherine remembered about her mail The only letter Ive opened is my  husbands. Lewis will you fetch in the o thers?  When people say they do not care what others think of them for the most part  they deceive themselves.  Note 4. The other day is a set phrase meaning     .  ll. The use of articles with countable nouns modified by  numerals. Cardinal numerals serve as descriptive attributes.  e.g. He had refused three invitations to golf his excuse to his  friends being that he had no time.  If a noun modif ied by a cardinal numeral is used with the def - inite article this is accounted for by the situation or context.  e.g. By candlelight the two men seemed of an age if indeed not of  the same family.  Ordinal numerals are usually limiting attributes.  e.g. Duri ng the second week in October she met him in Oxford  Street.  However when ordinal numerals are not used to indicate or - der but acquire the meaning one more or another the noun  they modify is used with the indefinite article.  e.g. They must have a thi rd race to decide who is the real winner.  After a moments hesitation she added a fourth spoonful of  sugar to her tea.  Note 1. The above mentioned rule does not apply to the numeral first. The combi - nation a first night   and a first prize are to be regarded as set phrases.  Note 2. Different articles are used in the following patterns with nouns modi - fied by cardinal and ordinal numerals the third chapter but chapter 3 three the  fifth page but page 5 five.   12. The use of articles with c ountable nouns modified by  participles. Attributes expressed by participles see Verbals .  173 -180 252 -254 are placed either in pre - or post -position to     the noun they modify.  When they are placed in pre -position they are usually de - scriptive attributes like adjectives.  e.g. They lived in a newly painted house.  There was a faded photograph and an ash -tray on the desk.  The use of the definite article in this case is usually accounted  for by the context or the general situation.  e.g. At the corn er of the street there shone the lighted windows  of a club.  She collected the scattered pages of the letter and put it  away into her desk.  In post -position we usually find participle phrases but not sin - gle participles. They may be either descriptive a or limiting b  attributes according to the context or situation.  e.g. a It was a very small room overcrowded with furniture.  He took a medicine prescribed by the doctor.  b I adopted the tone used by my uncle Henry.  At length I reached the sixth floor  and knocked at the  door numbered thirty -two.   13. The use of articles with countable nouns modified by  ing forms. Attributes expressed by ing-forms see Verbals   163 -172 227 -232 are placed either in pre - or post -position to  the noun they modify.  When they are placed in pre -position they are usually de - scriptive attributes.  e.g. He looked at me with a mocking smile.  He turned and saw a crying boy.  In post -position the ing-form may be either non -prepositional  or prepositional. We generally find phr ases and not single ing- forms here. Both kinds of these phrases may be descriptive a  and limiting b according to the context or situation.  e.g. a There was no answer and he sent a telegram saying that  he needed some work done urgently.  John had an o dd way of looking at things.  b He took the path leading to the lonely cottage.  He could not bear the thought of leaving her in such a  state.   14. The use of articles with countable nouns modified by in - finitives. Attributes expressed by infinitives tend  to be descrip - tive. e.g. He willingly accepted an invitation to spend the weekend out  of town.  I made an attempt to smile.  He suddenly felt an impulse to laugh.  Yet sometimes depending on the situation or context the in - finitive may become a limiting  attribute.  e.g. They did not have the money to buy the house.  Thats not the way to speak to your parents.  At last he forced himself to lie quietly on his back fighting  the desire to answer back.   15. The use of articles with countable nouns modified by  clauses. Nouns can be modified by two kinds of clauses   attrib - utive A and appositive B.  A. Attributive clauses qualify the noun. They may be intro - duced by the relative pronouns who whose which and that by the relative adverbs where and when or asyndetically.  e.g. I will not describe the pictures that Strickland showed me.  His pictures gave me an emotion I could not analyze.  He wandered about the place like a man who has nothing else  to do.  Attributive clauses fall into two groups  1 Attributive  clauses that can be removed from the sentence  without destroying its meaning. They are marked by a pause sep - arating them from the principal clause. In writing they may be  separated by a comma. These clauses are never joined to the prin - cipal clause asy ndetically. Clauses of this kind are called non -de- fining clauses and they are always descriptive and do not influence  the choice of the article. So the use of the article is determined by  other factors the context and other attributes.  e.g. She told m e that she had discovered a wonderful young man  who was going to help her in the East End.  She asked me a question which I did not hear.  On her sofa there was a note -book open in which she was  preparing her lessons for the term.  When he at last got to the office where he spent so many  dull hours he gave a sigh of relief.  2 Attributive clauses so closely connected with the antecedent  that they cannot be left out without destroying the meaning of  the sentence. There is no pause between this kind of clau se and  the principal clause and in writing they are never marked off by  a comma. Such clauses may be joined to the principal clause ei - ther by connective words or asyndetically. Attributive clauses of  this kind are called defining clauses and they may be  limiting or  descriptive depending on the situation or context.  When attributive clauses are limiting the definite article is  used with the antecedent.  e.g. He took the cigarette that Robert offered him.  I remembered what I used to feel about the young m en Charles  brought to the house.  In the back of her mind was the memory that it was the city  her friend came from.  In Russian the antecedent in this case may be modified by the  words    ...  . When attributive clauses are descriptive the article with the  antecedent is determined by the context or the situation.  e.g. She stared at me with an expression that made me uncom - fortable.  Its not a story I could tell anyone else  Harry he said.  As a girl my mother had expected a husband who would give  her love and position.  In Russian the antecedent in this case may be modified by the  words     ...        ... . . Appositive clauses disclose the meaning of the noun. They  can modify only certain abstract nouns such as idea feeling  hope thought impression sense and the like. Appositive clauses  are usually introduced by the conjunction that  and are  similar to object clauses.  e.g. He ha d the feeling that all his efforts proved to be futile.  He put off the thought that he ought to have tackled the con - versation differently.  Appositive clauses are generally limiting attributes.  e.g. I am sorry she said and I had the impression that sh e meant it.  The idea that he can be of use made him happy.  I was annoyed by the sense that nothing intellectual could  ever trouble him.  Occasionally however the noun modified by an appositive  clause is used with the indefinite article.  e.g. She had an im pression that Charlie was speaking to his cous - in rather than to her.  I had a growing feeling that time was running out.   16. The use of articles with countable nouns modified by  nouns in the common case. Attributes expressed by nouns in the  common case are usually descriptive.  e.g. There was a glass door leading into the passage.  A silver tray was brought in with tea cups on it.  He sat on a kitchen chair.  When the modified noun is used with the definite article this  is accounted for by the situation no t by the attribute.  e.g. At the study door he stopped for a moment.  Lanny looked at the dining -room window and smiled.  Sometimes however nouns in the common case may serve as  limiting attributes.  e.g. I reached the house just as the Whitehall lamps were coining  out. Do you believe we can leave the Sawbridge question where it is - In this case the attribute is usually expressed by a proper name  and serves to show that reference is made to a particular object.   17. The use of articles with countable nouns modified by  nouns in the genitive case. The use of articles with nouns modi - fied by other nouns in the genitive case is specific. Before we  speak of the choice of the article it is necessary to find out to  which element of the combination it refers.  As ha s been said see Nouns  17 there are two kinds of  the genitive case  1 the specifying genitive which denotes a particular person or  thing as in my mothers picture the mans voice the rivers bed.  In this case the article refers to the noun in t he genitive case and is chosen in accordance with the general rules.  e.g. the boys   the boys    a boys  books       Roberts  Note. When the noun in the genitive case is a proper name there is naturally  2 the classifying descriptive genitive which refe rs to a  whole class of objects as in sheeps eyes a doctors degree a  miles distance. In this case the article refers to the head -noun  whereas the noun in the genitive case serves as a descriptive at - tribute. The article for the head -noun is chosen i n accordance with  the general rules.  e.g. We had not walked a miles distance when we saw the river.  It was only a mile from the cottage to the nearest village but  the miles walk in the hot sun seemed very long to Jim.  Is there a butchers shop in the str eet? I am looking for the butchers shop he said that used to  be here when I was a child.  As the article here refers to the head -noun the noun in the  genitive case may have the plural form and yet be preceded by the  indefinite article as in a sold iers canteen a girls school a three  miles walk a fifteen minutes break.  e.g. Would you like to go to a soldiers canteen and get some  food?  The College has a two years course.   18. The use of articles with countable nouns modified by  prepositiona l phrases. Attributes may be expressed by nouns with  various prepositions. Depending on the context or the situation  they may be either descriptive a or limiting b. e.g. a But you must know that a marriage with a boy in a jazz  band wouldnt last a ye ar. A man under such circumstances is always very helpless  b He always felt ill at ease among the callers at his sisters  house.  The darkness was almost complete and the boats in the har - bour were swaying to the rhythm of the seas breathing.  Within th is type of attributes special consideration should be  given to the so -called of-phrase which is very common. Of -phrases  may serve as descriptive and limiting attributes.  Descriptive of -phrases are recognized by clear -cut meanings.  They denote  quality   a book of interest a feeling of relief a question of im - portance a portait of a girl etc. quantity or measure   a temperature of  20 a distance of  three miles a box of two tons etc. composition   a group of children a flock of birds a party of  twelve people a team of hockey players etc. material   a wall of glass a ring of gold a scarf of thick wool  etc. content   a cup of tea a bottle of milk a packet of cigarettes etc. age  a boy of five a man of middle age etc. size  a sailor of mid dle height a building of enormous size etc. comparison   a wild cat of a woman a woman like a wild cat  an angel of a wife a wife like an angel a devil of a boy a boy like a devil etc.  Here also belong such combinations as a friend of mine a  book of my own etc. Nouns modified by descriptive of -phrases usually take the in - definite article. But the definite article may also be used and then  it is accounted for by the context or by the situation.  All other of -phrases are limiting and conseque ntly the head - noun is used with the definite article. As limiting of -phrases ex - press a great variety of meanings there is no point in classifying  them. The most common types of combinations are the house of  my neighbour the wife of a miner the foot  of the mountain the  collar of a shirt the smoothness of a new machine the shot of a  gun the development of science the roaring of the ocean the in - vention of the radio the use of articles the name of John the  city of New York the position of a teacher the colour of amber  the shadow of a tree the outline of a boat.  In some cases however the choice of the article is affected  not only by the nature of the of -phrase but also by the following  factors  1 If the head -noun denotes an object which is the only bearer  of the property expressed by the of-phrase the definite article is  used the president of the club the glow of a lamp the murderer  of Caesar the monitor of the group etc. 2 If there are many objects of the same description the ind ef- inite article is used a member of the club a student of the group  a puff of wind etc. 3 The definite article is used alongside the indefinite when   there is a definite number of component parts the a leg of the  table the a wheel of the ca r the an ear of a dog.  The Use of the Definite Article with Countable Nouns   19. There are certain uses of the definite article which are to  be regarded as a matter of tradition  1 We often find the definite article used by reason of lo - cality i.e. with reference to objects that surround the speaker or  the people and things described by him. This usually refers to ob - jects either indoors e.g. the corner the window the table the  door the wall etc. or outdoors e.g. the stars the street the  trees the flowers the houses the leaves the birds the bees etc..  e.g. As I came up our street I saw my mother and my brother  waving from the window.  The late sun streamed across the kitchen and a patch of light danced on the wall.  A bee buzzed am ong the flowers.  The trees swayed to and fro under the grey sky.  The gulls flew low over the barges.  The noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds.  It should be noted that this rule applies only to a limited num - ber of nouns.  2 The definite a rticle is used with nouns denoting objects that  are usually found in a particular place. It is taken for granted  that the object is to be found there. For example we normally ex - pect to find a subject and a predicate in a sentence. Therefore in  analysing  the sentence The old man walked slowly we say The  old man is the subject walked is the predicate. But we say Old  is an attribute slowly is an adverbial modifier of manner as the  secondary parts are not found in every sentence.  When we speak about  the cinema or the theatre we say I couldnt  find my seat and asked the attendant to help me. In a cafe or a  restaurant we say Lets call the waiter. In a department store  we say Lets go to the mens clothing department At home we  may hear Ill put the kettle on and make you some tea. or Can  I turn the radio off? I want to read the paper.  Note. It should be noted that it is customary in English to use possessive pro - nouns and not the definite article when speaking about ones relatives pa rts of  the body articles of clothing and other personal belongings.  e.g. His brother was wearing a sweater up to his neck and chestnut hair down to his  shoulders.  Where is he? Stephen asked looking at his watch.  She put her hand into her bag and took o ut her handkerchief.  However in certain idiomatic phrases the definite article is the norm.  e.g. He took her by the arm and led her out of the room.  He was wounded in the leg.  For more examples see Pronouns  6. The Generic Function of the Definite Art icle  20. A singular countable noun with a definite article may  represent a whole class of objects thus becoming a composite im - age of that class but not a typical representative. A noun in this  function is called a generic singular.  e.g. The violet i s a lovely flower.  The cuckoo is a lazy bird.  To the philosopher language may be an instrument of thought  to the sociologist a form of behaviour to the psychologist  a cloudy window through which he glimpses the workings  of the mind to the engineer a series of physical events  to the linguist a system of arbitrary signs.  The aeroplane has made the world a small place.  Note 1. It is also sometimes possible to use the indefinite article in similar cases.  e.g. A violet is a lovely flower.  This use of t he indefinite article is not to be identified however with the ge - neric function of the definite article. The indefinite article is used here in its nomi - nating function implying any representative of the class. Hence the use of the in - definite artic le is not equivalent to that of the definite article when the noun is  used as a composite image of a whole class. For that reason the indefinite article is  not possible in the following sentences.  e.g. Now the horse has been replaced by the tractor.  In th is lecture I am going to speak about the article in English said the professor.  In other cases however when any typical representative of a class but not a  composite image of that class is meant only the indefinite article may be used.  e.g. A book mak es a good present.  A passenger is allowed to take 20 kg of hand luggage free of charge.  A word or word -group may be emphasized i.e. thrown into greater promi - nence.  A flower is always a beautiful decoration.  Note 2. Note that a plural noun used in a gen eric sense has no article irrespec - tive of whether it is parallel to a singular noun with the definite or indefinite article.  e.g. Violets are lovely flowers.  Aeroplanes have made the world a small place.  Now horses have been replaced by tractors.  Flowers  are always a beautiful decoration.  Note 3. When the noun man is used in a generic sense no article is found with it.  e.g. Surely he had suffered everything that man can endure.  The noun woman in a generic sense may be used with the definite article or  without any article.  e.g. He had always been interested in that mysterious being   the woman.  Woman is mans helpmate.  The generic article is always found with collective nouns de - noting social groups or classes. The article serves to emphasize  the idea of collectivity as in the proletariat the peasantry the  bourgeoisie the aristocracy the nobility the gentry the clergy  the intelligentsia the public the police. For concord of these  nouns with their predicate verbs see Nouns  13.  With other nouns the use of the generic singular is restricted  in two ways  1 Only a semantically limited group of nouns appear to be  used generically. We mainly find here names of animals plants  professions and occupations the nouns man woman and child  collec tive nouns denoting social groups and last but not least  scientific terms.  Note. In particular grammar terms may also be used generically.  e.g. The noun may have different functions in the sentence.  The article is a structural word specifying the noun.  2 Generic singulars are mainly characteristic of scientific and  literary prose where there is a need for generalization. That  means that there is a stylistic restriction on the use of generic  singulars.   21. The definite article is used with generic plur als but it is  found only when the idea of collectivity is definitely emphasized  suggesting the whole body of as in a the Russians the Ger - mans the Italians the Americans b the peasants the workers  the Tories the aristocrats the Liberals the  catholics.  e.g. The Italians have given the world some first -class film pro - ducers.  The Tories will not lift a finger to help the workers.  As we see from the above examples this use of the generic  definite article is found with names of nationalities r epresenta - tives of political parties classes social groups and also religious  beliefs. Note however that there is no article when not the whole  body of but separate individual representatives are meant.  e.g. Italians are often good singers.  Charles k new that his wife wrote articles for the paper and  had friends among left -wing people and liberals.  It should be stressed that the use of generic plurals is still  more lexically restricted than that of generic singulars as it is  found with a more limited n umber of semantic groups of nouns.  Yet it is not restricted stylistically.  Note. The noun people is used with the definite article when the idea of collec  tivity is emphasized.  e.g. All the people in the village liked the new doctor.  But if the idea of collectivity is not uppermost in the mind of the speaker  there is no article at all. e.g. She was speaking with absolute certainty All People are selfish.   22. The same generic use of the definite article is found with  substantivized adjectives e. g. the blind the poor the rich the  young the old etc.. This is also the case with some adjectives de - noting names of nationalities e.g. the British the French the Chi - nese the Japanese etc.. On the whole it should be noted that the  number of adjectives thus substantivized is very limited see also  Adjectives  6.  e.g. The British are a nation of newspaper readers.  The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  It is necessary to point out here that when not the whole body  but separate indiv idual representatives are meant a noun should  be added.  Cf. The young are often intolerant.  Ah well! Young men cant help making fools of them - selves he said amiably.  The old are often helpless.  The old woman was helpless.  Note. Adjectives followed by  ones may have generic force and then they are  used with the definite article.  e.g. It isnt the pretty ones that become good wives and mothers said Jack.  The little ones always know a good man from a bad one said the old woman.  The Use of Articles w ith Countable Nouns  in Some Syntactic Patterns   23. In some syntactic patterns we observe certain pecu - liarities in the use of articles. This refers in the first place to  the use of articles with nouns in the function of predicative or ap - position.  1 As a rule nouns used predicatively or in apposition take  the indefinite article. It is used here in its nominating function in   accordance with the general rule. It stands to reason that nouns  in the plural have no article e.g.  Predicative   Im a socialist of course he said.  All my friends were students.  Apposition   Im sure you know Alfred Hard a professor at London University she remarked.  My friends all students then often discussed the  war. Nouns used predicatively or in apposition may have descriptive  attributes e.g.  Predicative   He was an extremely boring fellow.  Apposition    Hart an uneasy nervous man made a few sarcastic  remarks.  2 The definite article in accordance with its individualizing  function serves to show that the speaker or writer is referring to  a definite person or object. As a rule the noun in this case has a  limiting attribute e.g.  Predicative   Philip had been the hero of his childhood.  Apposition   Then Jack the most impudent person there in- terrupted me. In addition to this rule it should be mentioned that a noun in  apposition is also used with the definite article when the speaker  takes it for granted that the hearer knows the person in question  e.g. What is it Maty? Its Mr Hooker the newspaper  editor  he wants to see you.  As the invited entered the house they were greeted by Elsie  the maid.  Erich Maria Remarque the German -born anti -war writer  said that his novels were successful because in them he told  about a generation which had been des troyed by war in  spite of the fact that it escaped death.  3 Nouns used predicatively or in apposition may have no arti - cle. This is found in the following cases  a when they denote a position rank state post or occupation  which is unique. Note that  the noun in this case usually has an of phrase attribute e.g.  Predicative  Mike Slattery was chairman of the Republican  county committee.   Apposition    W. Carl Johnson Superintendent of the School re- ceived me in his office.  Occasionally the defin ite article is also used in such cases e.g.  Predicative   I think we all realize that Mr Passant has been the leader of our group.  Apposition    So one day I took the opportunity to talk to Mr    the assistant director of the firm.  b when they denote a relationship and stress is laid on the social  position of the person expressed by the subject or the head -noun.  The noun is usually modified by an of -phrase in this case e.g.  Predicative   Mrs Nelson was wife of the manager of the firm.  He is heir to a rich manufacturer.  Apposition    Margaret daughter of a history professor was work - ing as secretary to a Labour member.  But usually we find the definite article here e.g.  Predicative   She was the wife of a local tradesman.  One of these young men was the son of an eminent  writer.  Apposition    Ann the daughter of the landlady cooked break - fast for the boarders.  Then I was introduced to Charles March the nephew  of our host.  Note. On the whole with the nouns son and daughter used predicatively or in  apposition we find the following three variants  a. She is the daughter of a doctor which is the most common variant express - ing mere relationship.  b. She is a daughter of a doctor which expresses the idea that the doctor has  more than one daughter the variant is not used unless this idea becomes im - portant.   She is daughter of a doctor which describes the social position of the person  in question.  c when nouns used predicatively serve to denote a certain  characteristic of the person indicated by the subject. The noun  predicative is usually followed by enough here. This case is not  found with nouns in apposition.  e.g. He isnt fool enough to believe that sort of thing.  She is woman enough to understand it.  d when predicative nouns are used in clauses of concession  with inverted word -order.  e.g. Child though she was she had suffered much.  Boy as he was he was chosen their leader.  Constructions of this kind are characteristic only of literary  style.  Note. There is no article with the predicative noun in the phraseological units  to turn traitor to turn p irate to turn miser.   24. In English there are a number of verbs which in the Ac - tive Voice require the use of nouns as objective predicatives a  and in the Passive Voice   as subjective predicatives b.  e.g. a They thought him a prig.  They named the  child John.  b He was thought a prig.  The child was named John.  The number of verbs which can be used in sentences con - taining an objective or a subjective predicative expressed by a  noun is limited. The most commonly used of them are to appoint  to cal l to choose to elect to fancy to imagine to make to  name to think.  Note. There are a number of other verbs requiring the same construction but  they belong to literary style. Some of these verbs may be used both in the passive  and active construction s others occur only in one of them.  The use of articles with nouns which serve as objective a and  subjective b predicatives is similar to that of predicative nouns  and nouns in apposition see Articles  23.  e.g. a They appointed him a member of the delegation.  We elected him an honorary member of the Committee.  He fancied her the most wonderful woman in the world.  They chose him chairman of the Society.  They appointed him secretary of the new Committee.  b He was appointed a member of the delegat ion. He was elected an honorary member of the Committee.  She was thought the most impudent little flirt in London.  He was chosen chairman of the Society.  He was appointed secretary of the new Committee.  Note. In the sentences They took him prisoner and He was taken prisoner They  called him names and He was called names we are dealing with set phrases.   25. The rules given for the use of articles with predicative  nouns and nouns in apposition also hold good for nouns intro - duced by as. e.g. I regarded my  uncle as a terrible tyrant.  He meant it as a joke but forgot to smile.  He went to the conference as the head of the delegation.  He acted as interpreter for Mr March.  They nominated him as Lord Treasurer of the Council.  Although the use of articles with no uns introduced by as is on  the whole similar to that with predicative nouns and nouns in ap - position there is a deviation from the general rule   the indefi - nite article need not always be used after as. e.g. Rebecca was now engaged as a governess.  The man had agreed to serve as a witness.  Mr Stapleton had persuaded a leather merchant to take my fa - ther on as traveller  . I cant see him doing much good as a traveller said my  aunt.  Note. The above rules do not concern nouns introduced by as used for compar - ison. In this case the articles are used in accordance with the general rules for  countable nouns.  e.g. The city looked to him as brilliant as a precious stone.  You were as white as the sheet in your hands.   26. When nouns denoting titles military ranks or social  standing are followed by a proper name they are used without any  article as in Colonel Holmes Doctor Smith Professor Jones Aca - demician Fedorou Lieutenant -General Rawdon President Wilson  Prime Minister Forbes Queen Elisabeth King George Lord By - ron Lady Windermere Sir William etc. In such combinations  only the proper name is st ressed.  Note 1. But we say The doctor has come. The Prime Minister made an an - nouncement yesterday.  Note 2. The definite article is used in such cases as the late Professor Smith  the celebrated playwright Osborne.  Note 3. A foreign title followed by a p roper name is used with the definite arti - cle the Baron Munchausen the Emperor Napoleon III the Tsar Peter the Great.  The article is not used with some nouns denoting close rela - tionship when they are followed by names of persons as in Aunt  Polly U ncle Timothy Cousin John.  Other common nouns when followed by proper names are  used with the definite article as in the boy Dick the student  Smith the painter Turner the composer Britten the widow Dou - glas the witness Manning the geologist Fos ter the dog Bal  thasar etc. In this case both the common noun and the proper  name are stressed.  Combinations as above are found not only with names of per - sons but also with lifeless things and abstract notions as in the planet Mars the preposition on the verb to be the figure 2 etc. Note With names of persons in newspaper style there is a tendency to omit the  article in this case too. Thus we find  e.g. World middleweight champion Dick Tiger said yesterday that he will retain his  title against American Gene Fullmer.  However such combinations on the whole are not very com - mon. More often we find a proper name followed by an appositive  common noun.  e.g. Britten the modern English composer...  Turner the celebrated English painter...  Manson a pro mising young actor...   27. The article is not used with nouns in appositive of -phras - es when the head -noun denotes a title or a post  e.g. They nominated candidates for the post of President and  Vice -President . He got the degree of Master of Arts.  When I  was a young man the position of schoolmaster car - ried with it a sense of responsibility.   28. The article is not used in the adverbial pattern from - to in which the same noun is repeated after the prepositions as  in from tree to tree from street t o street from town to town  from day to day etc. Such combinations are to be regarded s free combinations not set phrases as the number of nouns thus  used is practically unlimited. Care should be taken not to confuse  such free combinations with set p hrases which are somewhat sim - ilar to the above mentioned pattern but limited in number  a from head to foot from top to toe from top to bottom from  beginning to end from South to North. Here after the prepo - sitions from ... to we find two differe nt nouns not the same noun.  The number of such units is limited.  b hand in hand arm in arm shoulder to shoulder face to  face day by day. The same noun connected by different preposi - tions is repeated here. The number of such units is also limited.   29. There is no article with nouns in direct address.  e.g. How is my wife doctor?  Well young man said Eden with a smile what can I do  for you?   30. After the exclamatory what we find the indefinite article  with singular nouns.  e.g. What a c ar! she exclaimed.  I thought what an unhappy man he must be!  What a narrow -minded suspicious woman Maria was!  With plural nouns there is no article in accordance with the  general rules.  e.g. What marvellous books youve got!  It is noteworthy that no art icle is used after the interrogative  what modifying a noun.  e.g. What question did you want to ask me?   31. The definite article is found within an of-phrase preceded  by one some any each many most none all several the first  the last the rest the majority.  e.g. One of the letters is from Tom she said.  Most of the lecturers had other jobs in the town.  Several of the boys knew that my father had failed in busi - Compare the above given combinations with one letter most  Lecturers several bo ys etc.  32. There is a fluctuation in the use of articles in the follow - ing type of combinations a sort of a man the sort of a man  what sort of a man this sort of a man that sort of a man  some sort of a man a the some what this that kind of a  man a the some what this that type of a man.  e.g. He showed us a new type of bulb.  What sort of a day have you had? I asked him.  I said Its not the sort of situation one laughs at.  It was too dark to see what kind of a hous e it was.  What kind of car was it? Ramsden asked.  The more commonly found variant is the one without any article.  THE USE OF ARTICLES WITH UNCOUNTABLE NOUNS  The Use of Articles with Uncountable Abstract Nouns   33. Abstract nouns like concrete nouns fa ll into two class - es countables and uncountables. 1 Among abstract countable nouns we find e.g. answer belief  conclusion doubt effort fact government holiday idea job lie  mistake opinion plan principle promise question reply sen - tence  visit word and many others.  Countable abstract nouns may be used in the singular and in  the plural.  e.g. He had a brilliant idea.  I like their method of work.  He always had brilliant ideas.     I like their methods of work.  The class of uncountable abst ract nouns includes such nouns  as anger beauty curiosity excitement freedom grace happiness  1 The division of nouns into these two classes is a matter of tradition and can  hardly be accounted for either semantically or grammatically.  impatience j ealousy love modesty nervousness pride respect  strength time violence work and many others.  Uncountable abstract nouns are used only in the singular.  It is sometimes difficult to draw a line of division between  countable and uncountable nouns. Som e abstract nouns are used  as countables in one meaning and as uncountables in another  Uncountable  Countable  work     a work     silence       a silence     decision     a decision       kindness     a kindness       experience     an experience        favour      - a favour      failure      a failure        society     a society       nature     a nature      grammar     a grammar          observatio n    an observation     e.g. They walked in silence along the path.  After a long silence he began his story.  She spoke with decision.  You must carefully think before you take a decision.  He is a wicked person who is insensible to kindness . If you write him you will be doing him a kindness.  He has been doing this kind of work for many years so he  has a good deal of experience.  It was an unpleasant experience and he didnt speak of it.  There are also a number of abstract nouns which appear both  as uncountables and countables without any noticeable change of  meaning e.g. chance change difficulty language profit reason  temptation torture trouble war and some others.  Some of the nouns that generally tend to be uncountable are  in cert ain constructions regularly used with the indefinite article.  Here belong comfort disgrace disappointment  pity pleasure re - lief shame and some others. They are found with the indefinite  article when they are used as predicatives after a formal it as subject a or after the exclamatory what b e.g. a It is a pleasure to see you.  It was a relief to know that she was safely home  b What a disappointment!  What a pity!  But we say Ill do it with pleasure.  She gave a sigh of relief.  He now knew what disappointment was.  She felt pity for the poor child.   34. The use of articles with countable abstract nouns does  not differ from their use with countable concrete nouns in the  singular countable abstract nouns are used with the indefinite or  definite ar ticle in the plural they are used without any article or  with the definite article.  e.g. He told the child a story.  He told the child stories.  The child knew the story he told.  The child knew the stories he told.   35. As a general rule uncountable abstr act nouns are used  without any article.  e.g. Indifference and pride look very much alike and he probably  thought I was proud.  I knew that generosity would have been wasted on him.  There was sharpness in her bones sharpness in her voice  sharpness in her eyes.  She had attached herself to youth and hope and seriousness  and now they failed her more than age and despair.  The absence of the article the zero article serves the same  purpose as the indefinite article with countable nouns i.e. it per  forms the nominating function.  Cf   When in distress people look for a friend.  When in distress people look for friendship.  His desire was simply for a companion.  His desire was simply for companionship.   36. The definite article is used with uncountable nouns wh en they are modified by a limiting attribute which may be expressed  in different ways.  e.g. He was in a state of the greatest excitement.  They were surprised at the curious silence into which he had  fallen.  He jumped at the abruptness of the question.  Som etimes the limitation is clear from the context.     e.g. It was very still in the house. Suddenly a faint sound could  be heard in the stillness.  A moment afterwards the lights round the garden suddenly  went out. In the darkness we felt lost.  For a long ti me they walked without saying a word. Jim was  the first to break the silence.  The definite article is used here in its restricting function to  denote a particular instance of the notion expressed by the noun.   37. The definite article is also found with  substantivized ad - jectives denoting abstract notions e.g. the ordinary the average  the beautiful the unusual the supernatural the extravagant the  unknown the regrettable  the normal the grotesque the unbear - able etc. e.g. You shouldnt think  youre something out of the ordinary  she said.  Do you believe in the supernatural? he asked.   38. The indefinite article is used with uncountable abstract  nouns when they are modified by a descriptive attribute which  brings out a special aspect of th e notion expressed by the noun.  The attribute may be expressed in different ways.  e.g. A dull anger rose in his chest.  There seemed to be a wonderful excitement everywhere in  the world.  There was a tenderness in his voice that moved her.  She recognized a pleasant irony in his voice.  Didnt you feel a certain impatience? they asked.  His face had a calmness that was new to her.  She had a natural grace that was very attractive.  He had a patience which amazed his friends.  His new experience filled him with a  singular enthusiasm.   The indefinite article is used here in its aspective function.  By way of exception the aspective indefinite article is some - times used even when the noun has no attribute.  e.g. After a time a loneliness fell upon the two men.  There  was a bitterness in her voice.  A loneliness means a certain loneliness and a bitterness  means a certain bitterness here.  It should be stressed that the use of the indefinite article with  uncountable abstract nouns is typical of literary style see the  ex- amples above.   39. Sometimes an uncountable abstract noun is used with an  attribute and yet has no article. This seems to contradict the gen - eral rule but it can actually be explained by the nature of the at - tribute a or the nature of the noun b. a In some cases the attribute does not bring out a special as - pect of the notion expressed by the noun. The attribute may ex - press degree e.g. great perfect sufficient huge tremendous im - mense sheer utter complete infinite endless majo r and some  others or qualify the noun from the point of view of time e.g.  modern ancient impending eternal daily contemporary fur - ther final original nationality e.g. English French etc. ge - ography e.g. Moscow London world etc. au thenticity e.g - real genuine authentic symbolic etc. or give it social charac - teristic e.g. bourgeois capitalist racial religious etc..  e.g. I have perfect confidence in him.  She has great experience in her work.  Im sure your work will give y ou complete satisfaction.  He had sufficient ability to carry out any complicated task.  The reward had only symbolic value.  I didnt think it had real importance.  They talked about modern poetry.  He was conscious of impending danger.  Its three oclock by Moscow time.  Ron was particularly interested in ancient sculpture.  Mrs Peters feeling instinctively that Greek architecture  would leave her cold excused herself from the excursion.  Note. But the definite article is used with the combinations French poetr y modern art American literature German philosophy etc. if there is a limiting at - tribute as in the Russian literature of that period the French poetry of the 19th  century etc. b Some nouns are never used with the indefinite article. They  are nou ns of verbal character denoting actions activity process  such as admiration advice applause approval assistance concern  encirclement guidance information permission progress recogni - tion research torture trade   work and some others.  This rule applies also to the following nouns change   fun health luck money nature news outer space weather and some others.  e.g. I am not sure whether it is good news or bad.  He was anxiously waiting for permission to begin his experi - ment.  As I knew Mr March always expressed gloomy concern if  one of his children had a sore throat.  He wondered whether her silence was tacit approval.  He felt honest admiration for his colleague.  Note 1. It should be no ted that in a considerable number of cases both factors  i.e. the character of the attribute and the character of the noun are found together  e.g. She was making great progress.  They promised Jackson further assistance.  Note 2. Although the above mention ed nouns are never used with the indefinite  article they can be used with the definite article  e.g. He told me of the progress he was making.  The news was so upsetting that she said she would not see anyone that night  Note 3. Notice the sentence pattern s with the noun weather  e.g. The weather is fine cold etc.  What is the weather like today?  If the weather changes...  We are having fine weather.  What cold weather we are having!  I wouldnt like to go out in such bad weather.  A spell of warm weather set in. We had a spell of bad weather.  They were discussing talking about the weather.  The flight was cancelled because of the bad weather.  Note 4. The noun wind is uncountable.  e.g. There isnt much wind today.  Yet it is regularly used with the defi nite article.  e.g. The wind was blowing and it was cold.  The wind is rising falling.  He ran like the wind.  But if the noun wind is modified by a descriptive attribute it is used with the  aspective indefinite article  e.g. A cold wind was blowing from the  north.  For stylistic purposes it may be used in the plural  e.g. The cold winds blew the leaves off the trees.  Note 5. Notice the sentence patterns with the noun life e.g. Life goes on ever changeless and changing.  Life is worth living.  They began a new life. They were leading a happy life.  The life he is leading now causes everyone distress.   40. Sometimes the use of articles with an uncountable ab - stract noun is affected by the syntactic function of the noun.  1 Nouns in attributive and adverbial pre positional phrases of  manner have no article even if they have descriptive attributes.  Attributive prepositional phrases are usually introduced by  the preposition of other prepositions may also be found but not  often.  e.g. His flush of anger died as he began to listen more attentively.  An odd feeling of curiosity made him look through the keyhole.  He awoke with a feeling of sharp anticipation.  His face bore a look of cold disapproval.  He had an unsatisfied hunger for knowledge.  Adverbial prepositional ph rases are usually introduced by the  preposition with sometimes in. other prepositions may also be  found in this case but not often.  e.g. The old man looked at the boy with curiosity.  He turned round in annoyance and then walked away.  You have seen i t? he asked with intense interest.  Ann examined everything about her with great care.  She kissed him with warm affection.  The tendency to use the noun in attributive and adverbial  prepositional phrases without any article is so strong that some - times eve n countable nouns have no article in these functions.  e.g. It is a question of principle and it must be discussed before  we take a decision.  It was just a plain statement of fact.  He refused to help us without apparent reason.  He listened without remark w hile Robert poured out his heart  to him.  The young doctor was received in amiable fashion.  The door closed without sound.  He spoke with effort.  However the use of the indefinite article in such cases is still  the norm with a vast majority of countable nou ns. Although the general tendency is to use abstract uncountable  nouns in attributive and adverbial prepositional phrases without  articles occasionally either the definite or the indefinite article  may be found.  The use of the definite article is generall y associated with the  use of limiting attributes modifying the noun.  e.g. May I speak to you in the strictest confidence? he asked.  No said Eric after the slightest hesitation.  He watched her go from group to group with the same ease.  He trembled all over with the exertion of keeping himself up - right.  The use of the indefinite article appears to be optional   it seems to depend on the desire of the speaker to lay particular  stress on the special aspect expressed by the attribute modifying  the noun. Th us it would be correct to use the nouns in the follow - ing examples without articles in accordance with the general rule.  e.g. We looked at her face and saw the distorting lines of a deep  and anxious weariness.  He smiled at me with a grave sympathy.  He wa lked in a solemn silence.  In some cases however the use of the indefinite article is  obligatory. It is always used in prepositional phrases in which the  noun is modified either by the adjectives certain said peculiar or by  an attributive clause.  e.g. The  girl interrupted him with a certain impatience in her voice.  She spoke to strangers with a peculiar intimacy.  He gripped his hand with an abruptness that revealed his  emotion.  He entertained with an originality that pleased.  2 There is a tendency to use an uncountable abstract noun in  the function of a predicative without any article even if the noun  has a descriptive attribute.  e.g. The result of the experiment had been dismal failure.  It was righteous punishment he exclaimed.  When they were together  it was pure happiness.  I suspected that this was not just ordinary anxiety.  Prepositional phrases in the function of a predicative are usu - ally set phrases. Care should be taken to learn the use of the arti - cle in each case e.g. to be in despair to be  in service to be in pow  er to be of the opinion to be of importance to be out of control  to be in danger to be out of danger to be in a rage to be in a  good bad humour to be at a loss to be in a hurry etc. The Use of Articles with Uncountab le Concrete Nouns  Names of Materials  41. Uncountable concrete nouns names of materials are  generally used without any article. The absence of the article has  nominating force.  e.g. These sleeping pills should be dissolved in water.  She had nothing in the medicine chest but toothpaste and mouth -wash and shampoo.  Unlike uncountable abstract nouns names of materials are  used without any article even if they are modified by a descrip - tive attribute.  e.g. She said I knitted the socks myself of thick gr ey wool.  I ticked off the names written in violet ink.  He took out of his pocket an object wrapped in tissue paper.   42. The definite article in its restricting function is used  with names of materials if they are restricted in their quantity or  by reaso n of locality.  e.g. The boss took up a pen and picked a fly out of the ink.  Together they walked through the slush and mud.  He observed everybody who came in as they shook the thin  watery snow from their hats and coats.  Note 1. However there is no restri ction implied in such phrases and sentences  as a bottle of milk a cup of tea or The ground was covered with snow. The pond  was covered with ice.  Note 2. As is seen from the examples above most uncountable concrete nouns  are names of materials. However there are a few other uncountable concrete nouns  which are not names of materials e.g. machinery equipment furniture and some  others. The same rules are applied to them.  e.g. She hoped she would save enough money to buy new furniture.  The furniture the y had was enough for a much bigger house.   43. Sometimes owing to a change in meaning names of ma - terials become countable J and as such they are used with articles  in accordance with the rules for countable nouns. That means  that they may then be used  with the indefinite article.  Names of materials become countable nouns in the following  cases  a when various sorts of food products and materials are meant  e.g. They are now giving you bad teas in the club.  There is a beautiful display of cottons in th e shop window.  b when a portion of food or drink is meant  e.g. If you want to please the boy buy him an ice. We went into the pub and I ordered two whiskies.  A salad and two coffees will do she said smiling.  1 In the waters of the Pacific the snows of Kilimanjaro or the sands of the  Sahara the plural does not signify any change in meaning but is purely a stylistic  device.   sometimes the change of meaning is quite considerable  the noun comes to indicate an object made of a certain material  e.g. A full glass of orange juice stood beside him.  There was a tin of sardines on the table.  The Use of Articles  with Some Semantic Groups of Nouns   44. There are certain semantic groups of nouns which are  very common in English. These nouns are sometimes use d as  countables and sometimes as uncountables. Besides they are of - ten found as part of set phrases. They include the following se - mantic groups  Names of Parts of the Day   45. To this group of nouns belong day night morning  evening noon afternoo n midnight dawn twilight dusk sun  rise sunset daytime nightfall and the like.  1 When the speaker uses these nouns he often means a par - ticular day night etc. and then naturally the definite article is  used. The limitation is very often clear fr om the situation or the  context but it may also be expressed with the help of a limiting  attribute.  e.g. The night was warm and beautifully still.  He decided to spend the afternoon with his friends.  The weather was very cold on the day of his arrival.  Some times we find a descriptive attribute with nouns denoting  parts of the day but the definite article will still be used if the  above mentioned limitation holds good.  e.g. I could see a few faint stars in the clear night.  I was not in a hurry and walked al ong basking in the warm  evening.  The definite article is also found with nouns denoting parts of  the day used generically.  e.g. He used to spend the morning lying about the beach.  I often sat up the night with him and read to him to ease his  pain.  2 Whe n nouns indicating parts of the day have a descriptive  attribute and are the centre of communication in the sentence  .  they are used with the indefinite article in its aspective func - tion. This use of the indefinite article is mainly found in the fol - lowing sentence patterns  e.g. It had been a wet day the pavements were glistening though  now the rain had stopped.  It was a fine warm night and Charles and I decided to walk  home.  On a hot September evening he strolled idly to the embankment.  We were h aving tea in my room on a cold January after - noon.  3 Nouns denoting parts of the day have no article when they  are used as predicatives.  e.g. It was evening when he decided to lay his books aside and  take a walk.  It was nearly midnight and neither of us had eaten for a long  time.  It was dusk but I could see Henry walking across the field.  However if these nouns are used predicatively with a de - scriptive attribute the indefinite article is used see point 2 above.  But the article is not used with nouns  denoting parts of the  day if they are modified by one of the following adjectives  e.g. It was early morning.  It was broad day.  It was high noon.  It was late evening.  The adjectives early late broad and high do not describe any  part of the day here but  just indicate the time of the day with  more precision. Morning refers to a longer period of the day  than early morning or late morning.  4 In many cases the use of articles with nouns denoting parts  of the day has become traditional.  a In some preposi tional phrases either the definite article or  no article is found. They are to be treated as set phrases. The def - inite article is used in in the afternoon in the daytime in the  evening in the morning in the night. No article is used after the  prepos itions at by about past before after towards till until  e.g. at night at dawn by day   by night   by noon    by midnight    past noon about  midnight before dawn after sunset etc. e.g. I would take pills at night to make me sleep quickly but I  never found any pills that would keep me asleep till day- light.  Rain was now falling in sheets as it so often did before dawn.  After midnight I walked to the beach with him sad to see him  leave so soon.  b There is no article with the nouns morning day and dawn  when they are used as subject to the verbs to break to be at hand  the same is true of the nouns evening night dusk when they are  followed by the verbs to fall to gather to set in to be at hand to  come.  e.g. Day was breaking when we set out.  The sky was overcast and dusk fell early.  Dawn was breaking among the olives silvering their still  leaves.  c There is no article with nouns denoting parts of the day  when they are modified by the names of the days of the week and  the words tomorrow and yesterday.  e.g. I went to Aunt Millys house on Frid ay evening.  He spoke to Lin on the telephone on Thursday afternoon.  I shall see him tomorrow morning.  She was here yesterday afternoon.  Note. Compare We met on Saturday night       -     and We met on a Saturday night      -    . d There is no article in the following phrases all day long  and all night through but we say all through the night and all through the day day after day night after night day in day  out from morning till night to work day and night in the dead  of night late at night but early in the morning.  e There is a tendency to use the nouns denoting parts of the  day without any article in attributive of -phrases. Yet the definite  article is used when a particular day night etc. is meant.  e.g. He always woke up with the first sounds of morning.  After the bombardment he couldnt recognize the street that  had been so familiar to him at the beginning of the day.  Names of Seasons   46. To this group of nouns belong winter spring summer  and autumn AmE fall. The use of articles with these nouns pre - sents great difficulty because we find a good deal of fluctuation  here.  1 The definite article is used with these nouns when reference is  made to a particular winter spring summer or autumn present  past or future or to a season of a particular year. As a general  rule this limitation is clear from the situation or context but  it may also be expressed by a limiting attribute. The nouns usually  have the function of subject in this case.  e.g. The summer was exceptionally trying in the town.  The winter was very fine that year and we were very happy.  The summer wore on. He was stil l working hard.  The autumn of 1914 was very warm.  But when these nouns are used as the subject to such com - monly used verbs as to approach to be over to come to come to  an end to pass to set in and some others either the definite arti - cle or no art icle is found. In this case reference may be made to a  particular season or to the kind of season in general.  e.g. The winter came early and unexpectedly with a heavy fall  of snow.  The summer was over but we had not heard from him yet.  In those parts the spring usually sets in early.  The same fluctuation is observed when names of seasons are  used in general statements as a subject to a nominal predicate.  e.g. The winter is very long here.  The summer is a rainy season on the island.  2 The definit e article is generally found when names of sea - sons serve as an object in the sentence. This is usually found after  the verbs to hate to like to love to spend to talk about to wait  for and some others. In this case reference may be made to a par - ticular season or to the kind of season in general  e.g. He looks like somebody who spent the summer at the sea.  Dave loves the winter.  I liked the summer there on account of the bathing I think.  Sole. Although the use of the definite article is the norm in  this case occa - sionally no article is found.  3 When names of seasons have a descriptive attribute and are  the centre of communication they are used with the indefinite ar - ticle in its aspective function.  e.g. We had a short summer.  He had passed a s luggish winter and a lazy summer.  4 When names of seasons are used as predicatives they have  no article.  e.g. It was summer and the place broke up in red flowers.  However when these nouns in their predicative function are  modified by a descriptive attrib ute the indefinite article is used  see also point 3 above  e.g. It has been a terrible summer he said.  It was a remarkably fine autumn she added.  But the article is not used with names of seasons if they are  modified by the adjectives early and late which do not describe  the season but serve to indicate the time of the year with more  precision. Early summer means the first month of summer late autumn means the last month of autumn.  e.g. It was early summer.  It was late autumn.  5 There is a grea t deal of fluctuation in the use of articles  with names of seasons when they are used as adverbial modifiers in  prepositional phrases. After the prepositions in till until before  and after names of seasons may be used either with the definite  article o r without any article. Reference again may be made to a  particular season or to the kind of season in general.  e.g. The sun in the summer warms the skin but in the winter  when it appears it warms the heart.  In the autumn young Ben was to go to a pre paratory school.  Cant you wait until the winter? Sam asked.  I dont think theyll be able to get through with the work be - fore the winter.  But after the prepositions through for and during the definite  article is to be used.  . Through the autumn a busy time for me I was often uneasy.  Are you going to stay here for the winter? Jack asked af - ter a while.  He stayed in Paris during the summer and worked without a  break till autumn was well advanced.  6 In attributive of -phrases names of seasons us ually have no  article as in  the warmth of spring the dust of summer three  months of winter the colours of autumn.  Note. Note the following set phrases used adverbially to work winter and  summer early late in the autumn summer etc. all the w inter spring etc..  Names of Meals   47. The group includes the nouns breakfast lunch dinner  supper and tea. 1 In the overwhelming majority of cases names of meals are  used without any article. In this case neither the function of the  noun nor its b eing part of a set phrase is essential.  e.g. Lunch is ready and we can go in.  Dinner was at an end.  I was having tea with her.  He came in when we were eating breakfast.  John came to lunch at the appointed time.  They met for dinner.  Stay to tea said Mrs Watson.  His eyes still bored me as they had done at tea.  2 The definite article is infrequent with names of meals. It is  used in a clear case of back reference or if there is a limiting at - tribute.  e.g. The supper was very different from the one of the evening be - fore. The dinner was excellent but Isabel noticed that John ate  very little.  He was greedily eating the lunch his mother had given him.  3 The indefinite article is used when names of meals are mod - ified by descriptive attributes. The indefin ite article has its aspec - tive function.  e.g. Ill try to give you a decent lunch.  Walter wanted a very special dinner.  You can get a good supper here.  As soon as he was dressed he went into the library and sat  down to a light French breakfast.  4 Occasi onally owing to a change of meaning names of meals  become countable nouns. This occurs in the following cases  a when they denote dinner party tea party etc. Both the defi - nite and the indefinite articles may be found here.  e.g. Fleur said We had a  dinner last night.  I was having a wash and a brush -up before starting out to go  to the luncheon Elliot had invited me to.  Each Friday night Mr March used to give a dinner to the en  tire family.  b when they denote a portion. In this case the noun is used  with the indefinite article denoting one.  e.g. I have not enough money to buy a dinner at such an ex - pensive restaurant.  He wheedled a few francs out of me for a dinner and a bed.  Names of Diseases   48. This group includes a considerable number of uncou n table nouns e.g. pneumonia influenza flu in colloquial English.  scarlet fever cholera diabetes lumbago cancer diphtheria tu - berculosis consumption mumps and measles the last two are  used with a singular verb etc.  1 Names of diseases ar e generally found without any article  as in most cases they are used just to name the kind of disease.  e.g. The doctor said he had pneumonia and told him to keep warm.  The boy Roger arrived home with measles.  He had a bad attack of lumbago.  He had almost died of cholera.  She was suffering from diabetes.  The boy had been ill for two days and his mother thought it  was scarlet fever.  She fell ill with flu.  2 The definite article may be used with names of diseases in a  clear case of back reference or if there  is a limiting attribute.  e.g. The family were sitting around watching TV recovering from  the flu.  After the diphtheria Jane felt very weak and depressed.  Note. Certain nouns which are not special medical terms are used to name dis - eases. They may be cou ntable or uncountable.  e.g. He had a bad splitting headache.  He had a toothache.  He had a sore throat.  He had heart trouble.  I have a boil on my hand.  She had a bruise on her leg. The Noun sea  49. The noun sea is regularly found with the definite arti cle. This may be accounted for by different reasons. In some cases it  may be understood as a generic singular.  e.g. The sea covers nearly three fourths of the worlds surface.  He always spends his holiday by the sea.  In other cases it is used with the indi vidualizing definite article  e.g. A cold wind was blowing from the sea.  Lets go for a swim in the sea.  Certain Countable Nouns in Their Phraseological Use   50. There are a number of countable nouns in English which  are often used without any article as they undergo a change of  meaning and become uncountable.  51. The nouns school college hospital prison jail camp  church court bed table and occasionally market are used without  any article when as part of set phrases they lose their concrete  meaning and express the purpose which the objects denoted by these  nouns serve. Thus hospital comes to denote treatment prison  punishment school   studies bed  sleep etc. Compare the fol - lowing examples  e.g. After lunch Dr Reily went off to the hospital.  How long were you in hospital with that wound? she asked.  They had a hospital in the town during the war.  Madame Duclerk sat at the table darning socks.  I asked her to tell me who all the people at table were.  In the cafe we had a table to oursel ves but those around us  were soon filled.  The road to the prison was blocked by policemen.  He would be sent to prison if he were caught.  Perhaps he was in a German prison.  I softly drew the chair to the bed and sat down.  He went to bed early but lay awak e for a long time.  I found a bed made up for me and placed the candles on the  old-fashioned chest of drawers.  It should be noted that the use of a descriptive or limiting at - tribute destroys the idiomatic meaning of the phrases in question.  See the examp les above and also compare the following sentences  e.g. He was sent to school.  He was sent to a secondary good public school.  He was sent to the best school in the town.   52. The noun town in some prepositional phrases may be used  without any article when it means the centre or business part of a  town the town one lives in or the nearest town to a country place - e.g. She drove into town and drew up at the curb beside the drugstore.  I called up and asked her if she wouldnt prefer to lunch in town.  I thought that he would be out of town next week.   53. A considerable number of different nouns when used in  adverbial prepositional phrases have no article e.g. by train by  plane by boat by coach by bus by tram by taxi by air by car by  sea by p ost by mail by phone by radio by accident by mistake  by hand by chance by letter by land by sight at hand off hand   in detail in person on board on deck on foot on tiptoe at sea to  sea on hand on leave on business on holiday etc. e.g. It was nearly eight oclock and I had to go home by taxi.  I had already told her by telephone about my talk with  Keats.  You neednt tell me about it in detail.   54. There is no article in a number of combinations con - sisting of a preposition  a noun  a preposition. Such set phras - es are to be treated as compound prepositions e.g. in addition to  in charge of in contrast with in regard to in support of in reply  to in connection with on account of in comparison with in con - formity with i n honour of in memory of in pursuit of in favour  of in combination with in answer to in defiance of with regard  to in recognition of in return for in place of in relation to in  search of by reason of by way of etc. e.g. I rushed through the passage in search of my mother.  My father found himself in charge of a factory.  However in some other set phrases built up on the same pat - tern the definite article is used e.g. under the influence of in the  centre of on the invitation of by the side  of in the middle of on  the initiative of under the pretence of etc.  55. There is no article in some combinations consisting of a  preposition 4- a noun  a conjunction which are on the way of beco - ming compound conjunctions e.g. for fear that on c ondition that.  However in some cases the definite article is found as in on the ground that for the reason that.   56. The definite article is used in the following set phrases to the forest in to across the fields to at the cinema to at th e theatre to the pictures to in the country on the spot in the  slums in the trenches. Note however that the nouns museum  picture gallery concert exhibition do not form such set phrases.  e.g. I took Marian aside and asked her to come for a wal k. We  went to the fields.  We had an early dinner and went to the theatre.  Oh he said Sarahs come in. Shes been to the pictures.  I knew that Aunt Lin would not ring up because it was her  afternoon at the cinema.  But if these nouns indicate a particu lar object the articles are  used with them in accordance with the general rules. But this  case is not common.  e.g. We found that the film was on at a cinema across the river.  Charles suggested that we should have a meal and go to a the - atre.   57. The de finite article is also used in the following set  phrases to play the piano to play the violin and the like. But no  article is found in the combinations to play volleyball. to play  hockey to play golf to play cards and the like.  The Use of Articles wi th Nouns Denoting  Unique Objects   58. There are a number of nouns in English denoting either  concrete objects or abstract notions which are considered to be  unique. These nouns are neither countable nor uncountable as on  the one hand they express onenes s but on the other hand the  idea of more -than-oneness is inconceivable in connection with  them 1. Such nouns are used with the definite article as reference  is always made to the same object or notion. They include  1 Occasionally some of these nouns ar e used in the plural for stylistic purposes.  e.g. The morning skies were heavy with autumn mists.  1 names of unique objects such as the sun the moon the  earth the world the globe the universe the Milky Way the  ground the cosmos the atmosphere.  e.g. The sun was falling flat across the field and the grass was  pale with it.  We had been there all day the whole party of us the ground  was littered with our picnic.  Even when these nouns have descriptive attributes they may  be used with the definite a rticle in accordance with the rule stat - ed above.  e.g. Only the yellow light of the low autumn moon ruffled the water.  The stars were quivering in the frosty sky.  However the indefinite article in its aspective function may  also be used in this case. The n attention is focused on the noun  and it becomes the centre of communication which is as usual  marked by strong stress.  e.g. There was a splendid tropical moon and a soft breeze last  night.  It was a glorious night with a great full moon gleaming in a  purple sky.  My first reply was Of course I want to see a better world.  It should be noted that the above use is typical of literary style.  2 names of unique notions such as the present the past the  future the singular the plural the South the Nor th the East the  West the equator the horizon the post the press the telegraph  the telephone the radio. But TV the television.  e.g. The film star had a particular smile for the press.  presently the sun rose over the horizon.  I knew that the fut ure was going to be full of pain for me.  The telephone in this town Hallam said is as private as  the radio.  Note. The above rule does not concern the nouns radio and telephone indicating  concrete objects  Somewhere a radio softly played.  The use of articles with these nouns modified by descriptive  attributes is the same as that with nouns denoting unique objects.  Compare   Even the distant future looked quite gloomy to him.  Everyone believed that he had a brilliant future before  him.  Note. Note the following set phrases at present      in the  past     in the future    in future    . The Use of Articles with Proper Names   59. The use of articles with proper names seems to be based  mainly on tradition.  It is true that some cases  might be accounted for historically.  Thus we can say that the use of articles with names of certain  countries is due to foreign usage the Senegal the Tyrol. In other  cases the article may be due to the ellipsis of a common noun  which was formerly added  the Sahara desert the Crimea pen  insula the Pacific ocean the Baltic sea the Bedford hotel  the Lancet magazine. In the Urals the use of the definite article  may be explained by the fact that the noun originates from the  name of a mountain  range the Congo may have the article be - cause the name originally denotes the river. Names of rivers are  used with the definite article because formerly the noun river of- ten preceded the proper name the river Thames.  Although historical explanations of that kind may be con - vincing they are not of great help from the viewpoint of present - day English. In modern English the use of articles with proper  names lacks regularity and so does not always seem consistent.  Proper names fall into various groups  such as names of per - sons geographic names names of newspapers and magazines  boats hotels public buildings etc. Moreover geographic names  may be divided into subgroups such as names of countries con - tinents cities and towns rivers lakes sea s oceans islands  peninsulas etc. The use of articles with each of the above men - tioned groups and subgroups has peculiarities of its own. Within  each group there are typical cases and individual cases. Hence  it is necessary to describe the use of art icles with each group  separately.  The Use of Articles with Names of Persons   60. Generally no article is used with names of persons.  e.g. There was a letter from Susan inviting me to a party.  I did not see Charles Strickland for several weeks.  No article  is used either if names of persons are modified by  such attributes as little old young dear poor honest.  e.g. Young Jolyon standing by the little piano listened with his  dim smile.  When dear old Emily went back to town after staying with  them for a  fortnight she sent the children a dolls house.  We find no article with names of members of a family such  as Mother Father Aunt Uncle Grandmother Grandfather  Baby Nurse Cook when they are treated as proper names by the  members of that family. I n this case such nouns are usually writ - ten with a capital letter.  e.g. How nice that youve come! she said. Mother is still resting  but she will be down soon.  She went into the hall Is Nurse back?   61. However both the definite and the indefini te articles  may be occasionally found with names of persons.  The definite article is used  1 with a name in the plural to indicate the whole family  e.g. The Elliots were intelligent people.  He didnt even know the Browns had a daughter.  Hes very differe nt from the rest of the Jacksons.  2 with a name modified by a limiting attribute  e.g. Is he the Jones who is a writer?  Now she was more like the Julia of their first years of marriage.  3 with a name modified by a descriptive attribute when the limi - tation is clear from the context or situation a or when the at - tribute indicates a permanent quality of the person in question b.  e.g. a A remarkable number of guests went without coffee be - cause it was not the right sort a detail that had been  overlo oked by the embarrassed Otto.  b He slapped him on. the shoulder which startled and slight - ly annoyed the prim George Augustus  The indefinite article is used  1 to indicate that one member of a family is meant  e.g. I have often wondered if Arthur was  really a Burton.  2 with a name modified by a descriptive attribute when it is the centre of communication in the sentence  e.g. He was met at the door by an angry Isabel who demanded to  know what he meant by coming home at that hour.  Note 1. If a name i s preceded by Mr Mrs or Miss it may be used with the in - definite article to denote a certain.  e.g. He was a lawyer a Mr Reid from Melbourne.  My landlady knocked at the door and said A Mr Parkis to see you thus in - dicating by a grammatical article  the social status of my caller.  Note 2. Sometimes owing to a change of meaning names of persons become  countable nouns indicating concrete objects a or typical features associated with  a well -known name b. The articles with such nouns are used in ac cordance with  the general rules for countable nouns.  e.g. a Lanny has sold them an especially fine Goya.  He wanted to know how much a Buick cost. There was a rack of books and among them he saw a Hemingway  b She felt like an Alice in Wonderland.  Mozart was called the Raphael of music.  Swithin smiled and nodding at Bosinney said Why you are quite a Monte  Cristo.  The Use of Articles with Geographic Names   62. In the use of articles with geographic names there are  two prevailing tendencies some of the m are traditionally used  without any article others require the definite article.  As there seems to be no principle underlying the difference in  the use or the absence of the article with geographic names it is  more convenient to divide them into semanti c groups and consider  the use of articles in each of them.  1 Names of continents are used without any article e.g. Eu- rope Asia Africa Australia South America North America.  No article is used either when names of continents are modi - fied by such attributes as northern southern western eastern  central minor south -west south east Latin e.g. Northern Eu  rope North America Central Africa Asia Minor South East  Asia Latin America etc. But we say the Arctic and the Antarctic regions mea ning the  sea and the land round the North and South poles.  2 Names of countries a states or provinces b cities c  towns d and villages e are as a rule used without any article.  e.g. a France Great Britain China Brazil etc. bCalifornia K ashmir Brittany Katanga etc. cMoscow Oslo Rome Delhi etc. dBrighton Hastings Tartu etc. eGrasmere Patterdale Appledore etc. No article is used either when these nouns have such at - tributes as northern southern eastern western ancient  old new central industrial medieval modern e.g. West Germa - ny Old England Ancient Greece Southern France etc. Some of these nouns however are traditionally used with the  definite article though nowadays there is a tendency to omit the  artic le with some of them e.g.  a countries the USA the FRG the Argentine but Argenti - na the Lebanon the Netherlands the Low Countries the  Cameroon the Senegal the Congo  b provinces the Ukraine the Crimea the Caucasus the Ruhr  the Tyro l the Transvaal the Riviera the Soar  c cities the Hague.  3 Names of oceans a seas b straits c channels d canals  e rivers f and lakes g usually take the definite article e.g.  a the Pacific ocean the Atlantic ocean the Indian ocean  the Arctic ocean  bthe Baltic sea the Mediterranean sea the Black Sea  the Adriatic sea the North Sea the South Seas etc.  c the Magellan Strait the Bering Strait the Torres Straits  and also the Kattegat the Bosporus the Dardanelles  the Skager  rah etc.  dthe English Channel  e the Kiel Canal the Suez Canal the Panama Canal etc. f the Volga the Thames the Nile the Amazon the Missi - ssippi etc. gthe Leman the Baikal the Ontario etc.      But when names of lakes are preceded by  the noun lake which  is often the case no article is used e.g. Lake Baikal Lake Ohio  Lake Como Lake Superior Lake Ladoga etc. 4 Names of bays generally have no article e.g. Hudson Bay  Baffin Bay etc. 5 Names of peninsulas have no article if the pro per name is  used alone e.g. Indo -China Hindustan Kamchatka Labrador  Taimir Scandinavia etc. But we find the definite article if the  noun peninsula is mentioned e.g. the Balkan Peninsula the Kola  Peninsula etc. 6 Names of deserts are generally used with the definite arti - cle e.g. the Sahara the Gobi the KaraKum t etc. 7 Names of mountain chains a and groups of islands b are  used with the definite article e.g.   a the Rocky Mountains the Andes the Alps the Pamirs etc. b the Philippines the Azor es the Bahamas the East Indies  the Canaries the Hebrides the Bermudas etc. 8 Names of separate mountain peaks a separate islands b  and waterfalls c are used without any article e.g.  a Elbrus Mont Blanc Everest Vesuvius etc.  b Sicily Cuba Haiti Cyprus Newfoundland Madagascar etc. c Niagara Falls etc. 9 Names of mountain passes are generally used with the defi - nite article e.g. the Saint Gotthard Pass etc.  63. Geographic names that generally take no article may be  occasionally foun d with the definite or indefinite articles. This oc - curs in the following cases.  1 The definite article is found when there is a limiting at - tribute.  e.g. In Ivanhoe Walter Scott described the England of the Middle  Ages.  2 The indefinite article is fou nd when a geographic name is  modified by a descriptive attribute which brings out a special aspect.  e.g. The flier went on to say There will be a different Germany  after the war.   It was a new Russia that he found on his return. Note. The definite arti cle is always used with the pattern a common noun  of  a proper name e.g. the City of New York the village of Grasmere the Cape of Good Hope the Gulf of Mexico the Straits of Gibraltar the Straits of Malacca the Straits of Dover the Bay of Bisca y the Bay of Bengal the Gulf of Finland the Lake of Geneva the Island of Majorca etc. The Use of Articles with Miscellaneous Proper Names   64. This group of proper names includes names of various  places objects and notions. Within certain semantic g roups of  these nouns the use of articles is not stable   it may vary from  proper name to proper name. Hence it is sometimes necessary to  memorize them as separate items. In other instances it is possible  i to outline only the general tendency in the use of  articles within a  semantic group.  1 Names of streets a parks b and squares c tend to be  used without any article e.g.  a Oxford Street Southampton Row Kingsway Pall Mall Pic- cadilly Fleet Street Whitehall Wall Street etc. But names of so me streets are traditionally used with the defi - nite article e.g. the Strand the High Street and some others.  Note. Names of streets in foreign countries are sometimes used with the de - finite article e.g. the Rue de Rlvoli in Paris the Via Manzoni in Milan etc. b Hyde Park Central Park Memorial Park Regents Park     etc. But the Snowdonia National Park the Botanical Gardens etc. Note. Names of parks in foreign countries are often used with the definite article e.g. the Gorki Park in Moscow the Tiergarten in Berlin etc.  c Trafalgar Square Russel Square  Hyde Park Corner Picca - dilly Circus Leicester Square etc. 2 There is no article with names of universities and colleges  e.g. London University Cambridge University Oxford University Harvard University Trinity College etc. Note. The definite art icle is used in the combinations the University of Lon - don the University of Moscow etc. 3 There is a growing tendency not to use any article with  names of airports and railway stations e.g. London Airport Moscow Airport Victoria Station etc. 4 Names of theatres a museums b picture galleries c  concert halls d cinemas e clubs f and hotels g tend to be  used with the definite article e.g.  a the Coliseum Theatre the Opera House the Bolshoi The - atre etc. b the British Museum the  Scottish National Museum etc.  c the National Gallery the Tate gallery the Tretiakov Gal  lery the Hermitage the Louvre etc. d the Festival Hall the Albert Hall the Carnegie Hall the  Chaikovsky Hall etc. e the Empire the Dominion the Odeon etc.  f the National Liberal Club the Rotary Club etc. g the Ambassador Hotel the Continental Hotel the Savoy etc. But in newspaper announcements and advertisements the arti - cle is usually not found with these nouns.  5 Names of ships and boats are used with t he definite article  e.g. the Sedov the Titanic etc. 6 Names of newspapers and magazines are generally used  with the definite article e.g. The Times The Guardian The Lan - cet etc. Note however Give me a Times please.  7 The use of articles with names o f separate buildings varies  from name to name and should be remembered as a special item  e.g. Scotland Yard Westminster Abbey Buckingham Palace etc. But the Old Bailey the Tower the Royal Exchange etc.  8 Names of territories consisting of a word com bination in  which the last word is a common noun are generally used with the  definite article e.g. the Lake District the Yorkshire Forests the  Kalinin Region the Virgin Lands etc. 9 Names of months a and the days of the week b are used  without any a rticle  e.g. a January February March etc. b Monday Tuesday Wednesday etc. Compare however We met on Friday         and We met on a Friday        . 10 Names of state institutions organiz ations and political  parties are used with the definite article e.g.  the Liberal Party  the National Trust the Church the London City Council etc. But  Parliament in Great Britain the Congress in the USA NATO.  11 Names of languages are used w ithout any article unless  the noun language is mentioned e.g. English French Japanese  etc. But the English language the Italian language the Polish  language etc. Note. Note the phrases  Translated from the German and What is the French  for book?  12 We find the definite article with names of some gram - matical categories such as names of tenses moods voices cases  and others e.g. the Past Indefinite the Passive Voice the Condi - tional Mood the Genitive Case etc. The Place of Articles   65 . The article is generally placed before the noun with  which it is associated.  e.g. I was silent for a moment. Then I thought of the children.  If the noun is modified by an attribute or attributes placed  before it the article generally precedes them.  e.g. She had a pair of the most intelligent bright brown eyes  Robert had ever seen.  In the train we found an empty third -class carriage.   66. Yet there arc a few attributes in English which affect  the place of the article.  1 The indefinite article is plac ed after an adjective if that ad - jective is preceded by so as too and however.  e.g. We most of us hesitate to make so complete a statement.  They are as happy a couple as Ive ever seen.  It was too good a chance to be missed.  Travelling on however humble  a scale is expensive in Scotland.  2 The indefinite article is placed after the attributive phrase  too much of.  e.g. It was too much of a temptation for George to resist saying it.  3 The place of the indefinite article is optional if the adjec - tive whi ch modifies the noun is preceded by quite or rather. In this case the indefinite article may be placed between quite or rather and the adjective or before the whole phrase.  e.g. He seems quite a decent fellow.  He made rather a surprising remark.  But also  Its a quite fundamental disagreement.  Hes a rather hard man.  4 The indefinite article is placed after such and the ex - clamatory what. When the noun is modified by an adjective the  article precedes that adjective.  e.g. I never heard of such a thing  she said.  I cannot make such a categorical statement.  What a character he is!  What a dusty road this is!  5 The indefinite article is placed after many and in that case  the noun is used in the singular.  e.g. He told me this many a time.  I have heard many a young girl say that.  6 The definite article follows both all and double  e.g. She was ill all the time she was abroad.  Both the boys were late for dinner.  I offered him double the amount but he still refused.  It is noteworthy that the use of the de finite article after both  is optional.  e.g. Both the men were talking in low voices.  He signed both the papers.  The use of the definite article after the pronoun all is deter - mined by the general rules.  e.g. All children have to go to school one day.  All the children of the boarding school were in bed.  Note. Note that when both is part of the correlative conjunction both ... and ei- ther article may be found after it i.e. in this case the article is chosen in accor - dance with the general rules.  e.g. He was both a scrupulous and a kind -hearted man.  7 The definite and the indefinite articles follow half and twice.  e.g. Half the men were too tired to go.  It took us half an hour to settle it.  He paid twice the price for it.  They used to meet twice a we ek. Note 1. Note the difference in meaning between twice followed by the definite  article and twice followed by the indefinite article twice the price     twice a week     . Note 2. Half may serve as the first component of a com pound noun. In this  case the article naturally precedes it e.g. a half brother a half -truth etc. ADJECTIVES   1. Adjectives are words expressing properties and char - acteristics of objects e.g. large blue simple clever wooden eco - nomic progress ive etc. and hence qualifying nouns.  Grammatically four features are generally considered to be  characteristic of adjectives  1 their syntactic function of attribute  2 their syntactic function of predicative  3 their taking of adverbial modifiers of degree  e.g. very  4 their only grammatical category   the degrees of com - parison. Adjectives in English do not change for number or case.  However not all adjectives possess all of the four features.  For example Features 3 and 4 neither distinguish adjective s from  adverbs nor are found in all adjectives.  Furthermore there are adjectives that function both attribu - tively and predicatively e.g. He is my young brother. My brother  is young yet.. And there are also adjectives that function only at - tributivel y e.g. a mere child a sheer waste an utter fool or only predicatively e.g. glad able afraid alike alive etc..  Formation of Adjectives   2. Many adjectives are formed from other parts of speech by  adding different suffixes the most common of whic h are  -able comfortable preferable reliable  -ible sensible visible susceptible  -ant elegant predominant arrogant  -ent dependent intelligent innocent  -al cultural musical medical  -ic atomic scientific heroic  -ish childish foolish brown ish -ive attractive expensive talkative  -ful careful useful skilful  -less careless helpless useless  -ly brotherly deadly friendly  -ous dangerous curious anxious  -y dirty dusty sleepy  In English there is also a large number of adjectives ending in  -ing and -erf. e.g. His answer was very surprising.  The man felt very offended.  Such adjectives are former ing -forms which have become ad - jectivized i.e. they have partly or completely lost their verbal  force and acquired some or all of t he features of adjectives see  Adjectives  1 Verbs  172 179.  e.g. Mike made an interesting report.  The film was very interesting.  I should say it was the most interesting film of the year.  He is a disappointed old man.  He felt very disappoin ted when nobody answered his call.  I found him more disappointed than I had expected.  Sometimes it is the context that helps to understand whether  we are dealing with a verbal form or an adjective.                                I dont like her. adj.  Cf. She is calculating.                                                              Don t disturb her. verb                                                                                           to find her at home adj.  They were relieved      by the of ficer on duty verb  Sometimes the difference between the adjective and the verbal  form is not clear -cut and lies in the verbal force retained by the  latter. The verbal force is explicit for the ing-form when a direct  object is present.  e.g. His words wer e alarming his parents.  You are frightening me.  Similarly the verbal force is explicit for the participle when a  by-phrase is present.  e.g. The black man was offended by the policeman.  She was misunderstood by her friends.  For more of this see Verbs  227 245.  Classification of Adjectives   3. The actual application of adjectives is often explicitly or  implicitly connected with their semantic characteristics. So it ap - pears reasonable to divide adjectives into semantic groups each of  which has i ts own possibilities or restrictions.  I. As has been said in  1 most adjectives can be used both at - tributively and predicatively. They are central to this part of  speech as it were.  Besides there are adjectives that can be used only attributively.  To this group belong  1 intensifying adjectives  a emphasizers giving a general heightening effect a clear  failure a definite loss plain nonsense a real hero the simple  truth a true scholar a sure sign etc. b amplifiers denoting a high or extreme deg ree a complete  victory total nonsense the absolute truth a great scholar a strong  opponent utter stupidity the entire world etc. c downtoners having a lowering effect a slight misun - derstanding a feeble reason etc.  2 restrictive adjectives whi ch restrict the reference to the  noun exclusively particularly or chiefly the exact answer the  main reason his chief excuse a particular occasion the precise  information the principal objection the specific point etc. 3 adjectives related to adverb ial expressions a former friend   formerly a friend a possible opponent  possibly an oppo - nent the present leader  the leader at present an occasional  visitor - occasionally a visitor an apparent defeat  apparently  a defeat the lat e president  till lately the president.  4 adjectives formed from nouns a criminal lawyer an atomic  student a woollen dress etc. Adjectives that can be used only predicatively are fewer in  number. They tend to refer to a possibly temporary condition  rather than to characterize the noun. The most commonly used  predicative adjectives are able conscious fond glad ill subject  unwell ablaze afloat afraid aghast alight alike alive alone  ashamed asleep averse awake aware.  II. Adjectiv es are generally stative see also Verbs  2.  Many of them however may be treated as dynamic. Stative and  dynamic adjectives differ in some ways e.g. the link -verb to be in combination with dynamic adjectives can have the continuous  form or be used in the imperative mood.  e.g. He is being careful.  She is being vulgar.  Be careful!  Dont be vulgar!  Stative adjectives do not admit of such forms e.g. He is be - ing tall. Be tall!.  To the group of dynamic adjectives belong adorable am - bitious awkwa rd brave calm careful careless cheerful clever  complacent conceited cruel disagreeable dull enthusiastic ex - travagant foolish friendly funny generous gentle good greedy  hasty helpful irritating jealous kind lenient loyal mischi evous  naughty nice noisy impatient reasonable rude sensible seri - ous shy slow spiteful stubborn stupid suspicious tactful talk - ative thoughtful tidy timid troublesome vain vulgar wicked  witty etc. e.g. Im sure Nick will unders tand that its only for his own good  that youre being so unkind.  In those days a woman did not contradict a mans opinion  when he was being serious.  III. Adjectives are also distinguished as gradable and non - gradable. Most adjectives are gradable. That m eans that they can  be modified by adverbs of degree and themselves change for de - grees of comparison.  e.g. Your niece is so very extremely too young.  Tom is stronger than Father. He is the strongest in the family.  All dynamic adjectives are gradable most stative adjectives  are gradable too.  Degrees of Comparison   4. There are three degrees of comparison positive com - parative and superlative.  The positive form Is the plain stem of an adjective e.g.  heavy slow straight extravagant etc.  There  are two methods of forming the comparative and the su - perlative degrees 1 by adding the suffixes -er and -est and 2 by using more and most before the adjective.  The first method is used for  a monosyllabic adjectives  e.g. new  newer   newest  brigh t  brighter   brightest  b disyllabic adjectives ending in -er  ow -y or -le e.g. clever   cleverer   cleverest  narrow   narrower   narrowest  happy   happier   happiest  simple   simpler   simplest  c disyllabic adjectives with the stress on the second  syllable  e.g. polite   politer   politest  complete   completer   completest  d a few frequently used disyllabic adjectives  e.g. common   commoner   commonest  pleasant   pleasanter   pleasantest  quiet   quieter   quietest  The following spelling rules sho uld be observed in forming the  comparative and the superlative  a adjectives ending in -y preceded by a consonant change the -y into -ier and -iest e.g. heavy   heavier   heaviest  But adjectives ending in -y preceded by a vowel remain un - changed  e.g. gay  gayer   gayest  b monosyllabic adjectives with a short vowel double their fi - nal consonants  e.g. big  bigger   biggest  thin  thinner   thinnest  But monosyllabic adjectives ending in a double consonant re - main unchanged  e.g. thick   thicker   thickest  fresh   fresher   freshest  c adjectives with a mute -e at the end add only -r and -st e.g. pale  paler   palest  The second method is used for  a most disyllabic adjectives  e.g. careful   more careful   most careful  private   more private   most private  b adjectives of more than two syllables  e.g. personal   more personal   most personal  beautiful   more beautiful   most beautiful  c adjectives formed from participles and ing-forms  e.g. tired   more tired - most tired  interesting   more i nteresting   most interesting  d adjectives used only predicatively  e.g. afraid   more afraid  aware   more aware  The superlative degree of predicative adjectives in d is hard -ly ever used in English.  Note. Care should be taken to remember that most when  used before an adjec -  tive does not always form the superlative degree. It may have the meaning of very extremely7. Then it is preceded by the indefinite article.  e.g. He was a most interesting man.  A few adjectives have irregular forms for the degre es of com - parison. They are  good   better   best bad  worse   worst  far  farther   farthest for distance  further   furthest for time and distance  near   nearer   nearest for distance  next for order  late  later   latest for time  last for or der old  older   oldest for age  elder   eldest for seniority rather than age used only attrib - utively  Non-gradable adjectives on account of their meaning do not  admit of comparison at all e.g. daily empty full perfect round  square unique upper wooden and some others.  The comparative degree is used when there are two objects  actions or phenomena compared or contrasted  e.g. She had the kind of heart trouble that comes to much older  people . He found the work easier than he had expected.  I was now a more experienced man and it was not easy to de - ceive me.  His reading was more extensive than ever before.  The superlative degree is used when an object an action or a  phenomenon is compared or contrasted with more than two ob - jects actions or  phenomena  e.g. At that time I worshipped Manet. His Olympia seemed to  me the greatest picture of modern times.  She was the most active of us.  Note the following sentence patterns in which comparison is  expressed  a comparison of equality as ... as e.g. The boy was as sly as a monkey.  When he had left Paris it was as cold as in winter there.  b comparison of inequality not so ... as not as ... as e.g. The sun is not so hot today as I thought it would be.  You are not as nice as people think.  c comparison of superiority ... -er than -est ofinever  e.g. He looked younger than his years.  Youre much more interested in my dresses than my dress - maker she said.  My mother was the proudest of women.  To my mind the most interesting thing in art i s the personal - ity of the artist.  Its the biggest risk Ive ever had to take.  d comparison of inferiority less ... than  e.g. John is less musical than his sister.  e comparison of parallel increase or decrease the... the ... -er as  e.g. The longer I thi nk of his proposal the less I like it.  The sooner this is done the better.  He became more cautious as he grew.   5. Note the following set phrases which contain the cora - parative or the superlative degree of an adjective  a a change for the better for the worse      -      e.g. There seems to be a change for the better in your uncle. He  had a very hearty dinner yesterday.  b so much the better the worse        e.g. If he will help us so much the better.  If he doe snt work so much the worse for him.  c to be the worse for     -       e.g. He is rather the worse for drink.  d none  the worse  for        ...  e.g. Youll be non the worse for having her to help you.  You are n one the worse for the experience.  e if the worst comes to the worst        e.g. If the worst comes to the worst I can always go back home  to my parents.  f to go from bad to worse           e.g. Things went from bad to wo rse in the family  g as best               e.g. He made a living as best he could.  h at the best        e.g. She cannot get away from her home for long. At the best  she can stay with us for two days.  Substan tivization in Adjectives   6. Sometimes adjectives become substantivized. In this case  they function as nouns in the sentence and are always preceded by  the definite article.  Substantivized adjectives may be of two kinds  1 They may refer to a class of pe rsons considered in a general  sense. Such adjectives are plural in meaning and take a plural  verb.  e.g. The old  old people receive pensions.  To this group belong the following adjectives  a some adjectives describing human condition or character  e.g. the blind the brave the dead the deaf the disabled the eld - erly the homeless the injured the living the old the poor the  rich the sick the unemployed the wealthy the wounded the  young etc. e.g. The young are always romantic arent they?  The blind are taught trades in special schools  b some adjectives denoting nationalities and ending in -ish  e.g. British Danish English Irish Swedish Turkish Welsh in -ch e.g. Dutch French and in -ese e.g. Chinese Japanese Por - tuguese and the adjective Swiss.  e.g. The English  English people are great lovers of tea.  The Japanese Japanese people have achieved wonderful re - sults in electronics.  If we wish to indicate a single person or a number of persons  we must add a noun.  e.g. The old man receives a pension.  The young men are fishing.  The Englishman could not understand a word of French.  There were a few English people among the passengers.  2 They may refer to abstract notions. Then they are singular  and take a singular verb.  e.g. The good in him overweighs the bad.  He ventured into the unknown.  Do you believe in the supernatural?  Syntactic Functions of Adjectives   7. Adjectives may serve in the sentence as  1 an attribute  e.g. She had pleasant blue eyes and very long fair hair which she  wore in neat plaits round her head.  Adjectives used attributively usually precede the noun imme - diately. Generally there is no pause between the adjective and the  noun. Such attributes are called close attributes see the examples  above.  However if an adjective does not so much give a permanent  characteristic to its noun but rather refers to the temporary  state circumstance or condition under which what is said takes  place it becomes a loose attribute and may be placed in different  posit ions in the sentence.  e.g. Nervous the man opened the letter.  The man nervous opened the letter.  The man opened the letter nervous.  The meaning of the above sentence can be interpreted as The  man who was nervous opened the letter. Loose attributes t end to  approach to the predicative function.  Here are more examples illustrating loose attributes  e.g. Clever and tactful George listened to my story with deep  concern.  My father happy and tired kissed me good -night.  2 a predicative  e.g. Her smile wa s almost professional.  The sky was becoming violet.  He was aware of what was going on in the office.  Adjectives used predicatively tend to refer to a temporary  condition rather than to a permanent characteristic.  e.g. She is ill.  The child is asleep.  Note . Note the following sentence pattern which is commonly used to express  all sorts of measurements.  e.g. The water was five feet deep.  The train was twenty minutes late.  My watch is three minutes slow.  He is thirty years old.  3 part of a compound verbal pr edicate  e.g. He stood silent with his back turned to the window.  She lay motionless as if she were asleep.  He rolled onto his back and stared up into the tree where lit - tle black cherries hung thick.  4 an objective predicative  e.g. I thought him very  intelligent.  She wore her hair short.  In this function adjectives sometimes express the result of the  process denoted by the verb  e.g. The cat licked the saucer dry.  The powder washes the linen white.  He pushed the window open.  She made him happy.  The ne ws turned his hair white.  5 a subjective predicative  e.g. Her hair was dyed blonde.  The door was closed tight.  The vegetables were served raw the way he liked.  6 an adverbial modifier  e.g. When ripe the apples are sweet.  Whether right or wrong the m an ought to be treated fairly - If possible the child should be given the medicine three  times a day.  As is seen from the above examples adjectives used ad - verbially are all introduced by conjunctions. The phrases which  the adjectives are parts of can b e treated as elliptical adverbial  clauses.  e.g. When it is necessary he can be taken to the doctor.   8. Adjectives in the predicative function often require an ob - ject to complete their meaning. Objects to predicative adjectives  can be expressed by no uns with prepositions a by infinitives b  by ing -forms with or without a preposition c or by object clauses  e.g. a I was not aware of his presence.  We were all very interested in the result of the experiment.  b He was quick to understand what I meant . They were happy to hear the news.  c She is busy packing - Basil was little used to being heard with respect and was  resentful at being reproached with his own words.  d I was anxious that they should not miss the train.  He was glad that I was going on a hol iday.  2 Adjectives are often used to build up exclamatory sentences   in which an adjective preceded by how is placed at the head of the  sentence.  e.g. How charming your daughter is!  How warm it is today!  Place of Adjectives in Attributive Phrases   9. Adjectives used as close attributes precede the noun they  e.g. Nick could beat his father so badly at tennis that only paren - tal affection reconciled the older player to the poor show  he put up.  Sometimes adjectives are found in post -position to the word  they modify. It occurs in the following cases  1 if an adjective modifies an indefinite pronoun  e.g. Anyone intelligent can do it.  Ill tell you something wonderful.  2 in some set phrases e.g. the president elect soon to take  office the examination boar d proper as strictly defined court  martial attorney general heir apparent and the like.  3 if an attribute is expressed by the adjectives absent present  concerned and involved  e.g. The men present were all his friends.  The people involved were asked  to come at ten oclock.  Post-position is possible if an attribute has a modifier following it.  e.g. Peter and Tom were the boys easiest to teach.  Or  Peter and Tom were the easiest boys to teach.  They have a garden larger than yours.  Or  They have a larger garden than yours.  If there are several attributes modifying a noun their order  within the attributive group is best shown in the following table   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 epithet  size shape age colour  origin substance  attribute forming  a close sense -unit with a noun  noun Nick surprised went over to the window to re -read the letter.  Mother stood up from the table curious and anxious.   10. Note the place of the indefinite article when an adjective  happens to be modified by too so as and however.  e.g. She is too timid a girl to meet him.  Dr Grogan was in fact as wise an old man as my grandfather.  For this see also Articles  65.   e.g. a brilliant 1 young 4 man a small 2 round 3 table  a dirty 1 old 4 brown 5 coat a charming 1 Frenc h 6 writing 8 desk a large 2 green 5 Chinese 6 carpet  a famous 1 German 6 medical 8 school  a large 2 iron 7 box a big 2 square 3 old 4 chest  a tall 2 young 4 London 6 policeman  An attributive group in which all the spaces we re filled would  be rare and cumbersome. Adjectives used as loose attributes are  mobile in the sentence for this see also  7.  e.g. Unhappy the girl returned to work.  PRONOUNS   1. Pronouns include a miscellaneous group of words which  function in the se ntence as noun pronouns or as adjective pronouns.  It is difficult to define the meaning of pronouns. Unlike nouns  and adjectives they do not name objects or qualities but only  point to them. In other words they are devoid of concrete lexical  meaning. Th ey have a generalized meaning instead which be - comes clear only in the context or situation.  Various individual pronouns may have different grammatical  categories. Some of them have the category of number e.g this  these that   those others have th e category of case e.g. I   me somebody   somebodys still others are invariable e.g. each such  all what and some others.  It should be pointed out that although pronouns function as  nouns or adjectives in the sentence they do not cover all the  functions of the two parts of speech but can only have some of  them. Pronouns can be divided into the following classes  1 personal pronouns  6 indefinite pronouns  2 possessive pronouns  7 reciprocal pronouns  3 reflexive pronouns  8 interrogative pronouns  4 emphatic pronouns  9 conjunctive pronouns.  5 demonstrative pronouns  Personal Pronouns   2. We find the following personal pronouns in English    Singular  Plural  1 st person  I we 2nd person  you  3d person  he she it they I and we are said to be the prono uns of the 1st person i.e. a  person or persons who speaks speak. You is said to be the pro - noun of the 2nd person i.e. a person persons spoken to. He she it and they are said to be the pronouns of the 3d person i.e.  a person persons or a thin g things spoken about.  We distinguish singular and plural personal pronouns. Singu - lar personal pronouns refer to one person or thing and plural per - sonal pronouns refer to more than one person or thing. The pro - nouns I  we you he and she are mainly  used for persons. I  we and you are indifferent to gender while he is masculine and she is feminine. The pronoun it is used for animals concrete things and  abstract notions i.e. it refers to neuter nouns. The pronoun they is used for persons animals a nd things and is indifferent to gender.   3. In addition to the above structural meanings of the per - sonal pronouns they have a few other special applications.  It is a tradition to use we instead of I  in newspaper articles  scientific prose etc. This so -called editorial we is believed to  sound less assertive and hence more modest than I .  e.g. We are convinced that the Government has made a grave  mistake in imposing tills tax.  She is sometimes used for inanimate objects especially ships   motor cars  aircraft etc.  e.g. Come along and have a look at my new car. She is a beauty.  She is also used for countries and even cities especially in  rather formal and rhetoric speech.  e.g. France has made it plain that she will regret the proposal.  You may be u sed with reference to nobody in particular to  any person who might find himself in a similar position.  e.g. You dont know him. He is dishonest. You feel that he is ly - ing to you every moment of the day.  Have you been aboard Mrs Wilcoxs yacht? What do people  do aboard yachts? I dont know. You drink I suppose  Gregory said shrugging his shoulders.  In my youth during Christmas holidays I loved to visit my  classmates who all lived in small provincial towns. Once  you got into them each anonymous hou se held a promise  of fun. You didnt know who lived in them but maybe in  one of them as you went from the station to the house of  the people you were visiting there would be a pretty girl  getting ready for a dance.  They may be used to mean people in ge neral especially in  the phrase they say.  eg. They say hes going to resign.  No wonder they say the present generation hasnt got a scrap  of enterprise.  The personal pronouns are used as nouns in the sentence.   4. The personal pronouns change for case. There are two cases  for personal pronouns   the nominative case and the objective case.   The Nominative  Case The Objective  Case I you he she it we you they me you him her it us you them The forms of the nominative case function in the sentence as  subject s. e.g. I expect they will laugh at me.  Why dont you know what hes up to?  The forms of the objective case function in the sentence as objects.  e.g. I met him in the street direct object  He gave me some advice indirect object  Please dont tell any one about us. prepositional object  When personal pronouns are used as predicatives or after than- as and but the nominative case is considered to be very formal the  use of the objective case is preferred in spoken English.  e.g. Who is it? Its me I.  Do you need anything? A secretary that Ill dictate my  piece to. Ill be her.  Youre better off than them they.  She is as tall as him he.  No one can do it but him he.  But only a nominative case personal pronoun can be used in  the followin g sentence pattern where the pronoun is followed by a  clause.  e.g. It was I who did it.  The Use of it  5. As has been said the pronoun it is generally used for con- crete things abstract notions and animals.  e.g. I tried the door. It was locked.  He prom ised his help if ever I needed it.  He got down the horse and tied it to the rail.  Yet the pronoun it may be used to identify an unknown person.  Then once it has been done he or she must be used.  e.g. There was a knock at the door. I thought it was the po stman.  He usually came at that time.  When the waiter came up to his table he did not at once real - ize it was Paul. He was as handsome as ever.  It may also refer to an idea expressed in a preceding word - group a clause b sentence c or even context d. e.g. a He tried to break the lock. It was not easy either.  There was some mutual hesitation about shaking hands  with both deciding against it.  b He knew that his father was dying but he did not want to  speak with anyone about it.  c The music had stop ped. He didnt notice it.  d He studied her then shook his head. He waited a moment  and then decided not to say what he might have been go - ing to say. He swallowed half his whiskey before going  on and when he did he returned to the conventional  questions . She had watched him do it all without any in - terest.  It is very often used as a formal subject in impersonal state - ments about weather conditions time distance and all kinds of  measurements . e.g. It is raining heavily.  It was very cold in the room.  It is half past three now.  It is six miles to the nearest hospital from here.  It is three feet deep here.  It as the formal subject is also found in sentences in which the  predicate is modified by an infinitive phrase a or an ing-iorm  phrase b or a cla use c. We usually find nominal predicates in  this kind of sentences  e.g. a It is stupid to fall asleep like that.  It is a pleasure to see you again.  b It wont be easy finding our way home.  Its no use hoping hell ever change his mind.  c It was clea r that he was going to give in.  It was a surprise that he had come back so soon.  The formal it may be used not only as the subject of the sen - tence but also as an object followed by an adjective or a noun  which is modified by an infinitive phrase an ing-iorm phrase or a  clause.  e.g. I found it difficult to explain to him what had happened.  He thought it no use going over the subject again.  He thought it odd that they had left him no message.  The pronoun it is also used in the so -called emphatic con - struc tion i.e. a special sentence pattern that serves to emphasize  some word or phrase in the sentence  e.g. It was my question that made him angry.  It was on the terrace that he wanted them to lay the table.  Finally the pronoun it is rather often used in var ious idi - omatic expressions where it seems to have very little lexical  meaning of its own if any at all. Most of these expressions are  colloquial or even slangy.  e.g. Hang it all we cant wait all day for him.  Hop it old thing you are in the way here . When I see him Ill have it out with him.  If you are found out youll catch it.  Possessive Pronouns   6. There are the following possessive pronouns in English    Singular  Plural  1 st person  my our 2nd person  your your 3d person  his ha- lts their Possessive pronouns serve to modify nouns in the sentence  i.e. they function as attributes  e.g. The doctor usually came to his office at three oclock.  Do you think you are losing your popularity?  Prom my place I could watch the people eating their lunch.  It should be noted that in English the possessive pronouns are  often used instead of articles with nouns denoting relations parts  of the body articles of clothing and various other personal be - longings.  e.g. Bob nodded at his wife as if he wanted to sa y You see?  He bit his lips but said nothing.  He took off his jacket and loosened his tie.  Amy put her cigarette back into her bag.  But there are certain idiomatic phrases where the definite ar - ticle is used instead of a possessive pronoun  e.g. I have a cold in the head.  He was shot through the heart.  He got red in the face.  He took me by the hand.  The ball struck him in the back.  He patted his wife on the shoulder.   7. The possessive pronouns may also perform noun func - tions. Then they are used in t heir so -called absolute forms mine  yours his hers its ours and theirs.  e.g. She put her arm through mine.  They are not my gloves I thought they were yours.  Theirs is a very large family.  Incidentally its is hardly ever used as an absolute form.  Note. The form yours is commonly used as a conventional ending to letters  e.g. Yours sincerely truly faithfully . J. Smith  Sometimes we find absolute forms of possessive pronouns pre - ceded by the preposition of. This combination is called a double  genitiv e. e.g. He is a friend of mine.  It happened through no fault of his.  We had a slight accident and luckily that neighbour of  yours came along or we would still be there.  Reflexive Pronouns   8. The reflexive pronouns are formed by adding -self in the  plural selves to the possessive pronouns in the 1st and 2nd persons  and to the objective case of the personal pronouns in the 3d person.    Singular  Plural  1st person  myself  ourselves  2nd person  yourself  yourselves  3d person  himself  herself  itself themselv es There is one more reflexive pronoun which is formed from the  indefinite pronoun one  oneself.  These pronouns are used as noun pronouns in the sentence.  They are called reflexive pronouns because they show that the ac - tion performed by the person whi ch is indicated by the subject of  the sentence passes back again to the same person. In other  words the subject of the sentence and its object indicate the same  person. In this case the reflexive pronouns are weakly stressed.  e.g. He wrapped himself in hi s blanket and fell off to sleep.  She cooked herself a big meal.  Im sure you both remember the day when you talked about  yourselves and the past.  As is seen from the above examples the reflexive pronouns  may serve in the sentence as different kinds of obj ects  direct  indirect and prepositional.  Note 1. Note the following sentences where personal pronouns are preferred to reflexive pronouns.  e.g. He went in closing the door behind him.  She put the thought from her.  He looked about him. Note 2. Note that both personal and reflexive pronouns are found in sentences  expressing comparison.  e.g. My brother is as tall as myself me.  No one realizes it better than yourself you.   9. Reflexive pronouns may also be used in a different way  together with the verb  they may form set phrases characterized  by idiomatic meaning. The reflexive meaning of the self -pronoun  weakened in this case. The meaning of the verb differs from the  meaning of the same verb when it is followed by an object ex- essed by a noun or an ind efinite pronoun.  eg. He forgot Janes address   Im afraid hes forgetting himself   Finally I found the answer to the riddle   Finally I found myself near a railway station   She came to the theater ten minutes late   At last she came to herself      A few other verbs are always followed by reflexive pronouns  with which they form a close sense -unit e.g. to pride oneself on  something to avail oneself of something.  We also find idiomatic uses of reflexive pronouns in such set  phrases as to be myself himself etc. meaning to be or behave as  before  e.g. Im glad to see that he is himself again.  Besides there are a few prepositional phrases with reflexive  pronouns which are to be treated  as set phrases because they have  idiomatic meaning  e.g. Are we actually by ourselves again?   He was almost beside himself with excitement    In spite of himself he was interested     -      Go and find for yourself how it is done  It is a word complete in itself      As for myself I have no complaint to make      I came away and left him to himself      We can drive the car among ourselves      Emphatic Pronouns   10. Emphatic pronouns have the same forms as reflexive  pronouns   they are homonyms. Emphatic pronouns are used for  emphasis. They serve as noun pronouns and always perform the  function of apposition in the sentence. They can be placed either  immediately after their head -word or at the end of the sentence.  They are rendered in Russian as       . e.g. You yourself told them the story. Or You told them the sto - ry yourself.  My mother herself opened the door. Or My mother opened  the door herself.  We are all queer fish queerer than we know ourselves.  The parting itself was short but it made her ill with grief.  The emphatic pronouns are strongly stressed but nevertheless  they can be omitted without destroying the sense of the sentence.  Demonstrative Pronouns   ll. There are four demonstrative pronouns in English this that such and same. They all may be used as noun pronouns and  as adjective pronouns.  The pronouns this and that change for number. Their corre - sponding plural forms are these and those.   12. The pronoun this these refers to what is near in space  time or conception a that those to what is farther off b.  e.g. a Do you know these people? This is Harry Field my coach  and this is Jake Spring the producer.  Take this pear. It looks very ripe.  Look at this he said and showed me his tie.  When he s topped talking she wondered Why is he tell - ing me all this?  Maybe you dont want to go to this party he asked hop - ing she would say no.  b Do you see those houses in the distance? Thats where we  are going.  Is that your son?  They ate the pie and  drank the coffee in silence. When  they had finished Delany said Now Ill have that ci- gar you offered me.  He was deaf but she didnt think that many people noticed  that.  The pronouns this these and that those may also have other  applications.  1 In some cases this these may refer to what is to follow  that those to what precedes.  e.g. After Ive listened to you very attentively Ill tell you this  I dont think you should trust the man.  But Im glad to see you have an interest in sports. That  means we have two things in common.  2 This these and that those are often used with nouns indi - cating time. This these is used for time which is future or just  past. That those is used for time which is clearly past.  e.g. Why dont you come an d see me some time? How about  this Sunday if its convenient?  Father had to go to Chicago this morning.  I remember that he woke up early that morning.  She looked flushed and well although she had a heart attack  that summer.  3 Sometimes the use of this these and that those is emo - tionally coloured. The kind of feeling implied affection vexation  disgust contempt etc. depends on the situation.  e.g. Will this dog ever stop barking?  Do you really believe in those ideas?  When will you stop trumpi ng that piano?  He is one of those so -called modern poets.  4 The pronoun that those may be used instead of a noun al - ready mentioned. It is called a prop -word in this case  e.g. He found it easier to believe that her actions were those of a  spoilt girl.  He hung his daughters portrait beside that of his wifes.  These poems are not so good as those written by you last  year.  I entered by the door opposite to that opening into the gar - den. She was a good teacher. She knew how to teach bright chil - dren and  those who were slow.  I was interested to learn that the cafe was the same that we  had visited five years before.  As is seen from the above examples that those in this case is  followed by a prepositional phrase a participle an ing form or a  clause.  5 That is often used instead of it. In this case that appears to  be more emphatic than it. e.g. Im going to practise law. I have that all planned.  Lets send him a wire. Thats an excellent idea.  His gun went off and he nearly killed himself. I didn t know that.  Tell her Im sorry I missed her. Ill do that.  Im going to stay here a while. Thats fine.  6 Those followed by a who-clause a participle or an ing-iorm  refers to persons.  e.g. Serious newspapers are read by those people who wa nt to  know about important happenings everywhere.  Even those people who do not like his pictures are not in - different to him.  Those people injured in the accident were taken to hospital.  Note. Those present   and those concerned   -    are set phrases.  7 In spoken English that may be used as an adverbial modifi - er of degree.  e.g. I did not think he was that stupid.  I will go that far but no further.  He should know that much about his trade.   13. That this are of ten found as part of set phrases. Here  are some of them  e.g. Mike will tell you that I seldom pass through this place  without dropping in. Thats right.   . I have a car outside. Ill give you a ride home. Oh thats  all right. It isnt much of a walk. He  .  . My husband said you were properly brought up. He always  notices things like that. such things  Would you like a bag like this? such a bag  I hate it when they dance like this. in this way  I had never heard him  speak like that before. in that way  It was May but for all that the rain was falling as in the  heaviest autumn downpours despite that  My mother intended to have a glorious supper   not that  she could eat much nowadays but for the sake of style  and my sake    ... She was young and beautiful. More than that she was happy.     ... You ought to know better than that     Do you want to speak to me about your work? Oh hardly  that.            talked about his responsibilities and all that    -   Im thinking of your future you know. Thats why Im giv - ing you a piece of advice   After that I did not see him for several days     Marions concern was dire ctly for me. Yes it was a pity you  ran across her she said. Mind you I expect you puzzled  her as much as she did you   that is if I know anything  about you.    You know what people think when a man like him dies.  That is? People imagi ne its a revenge.  ?   ?  Lets leave  it at that         So thats that  -  -   I told you before I wont do it and thats that   That settles it.     . What were you doing down there or what was I doing there  for that matter?     Note. Note that English people speaking of their country say this country  whereas in Russian it would be    .  14. The demonstrative pronoun such may mean of this or  that kind a or indicate degree b. Such is followed by the indefi - nite article before singular countable nouns.  e.g. a If I were you I would not have said such a thing about him.  He was a silent ambitious man. Such men usually succeed . Such is the present state of things.  The position of Dan Crusher was such that he was wel - come in any club  b He is such a bore.  He wrote such desperate letters to me that year.  The meaning of such is often completed by a clause of con - sequence introd uced by that or a phrase introduced by as.  e.g. I had such a busy morning that I had no time to call you up - He cut such an absurd figure that I felt inclined to laugh.  I never saw such a handsome man as Jims father.  Mr Clark was afraid that his promotion  would never come  because there was such a thing he said as junior clerks  trying to draw attention to themselves.  Such may be followed by an infinitive with as. e.g. His carelessness is such as to make it unlikely that he will  pass his examination.  Note  that such may be combined with some indefinite pro - nouns.  e.g. Ill do no such thing.  He didnt say any such thing.  Any such request is sure to be turned down.  On every such occasion dozens of people get injured.  Some such story was told to me years ago.   15 - Such is sometimes found as part of set phrases. Here are  some of them  e.g. They export a lot of fruit such as oranges lemons etc.   for example    His education such as it was was finished by the time he  was fifteen        My services such as they are are at your disposal        John is the captain of the team and as such he is to decide  what is to be done     16. The demonstrative pronoun same means identical. It is  always preceded by the definite article.  e.g. We dont have to go all in the same car.  I was astonished and at the same time very much excited.  In autumn the sch ool re -opened. The same students came to  Georges classes.  His stories set ones imagination to work. The same is true  of his articles.  The meaning of same is often completed by a clause intro - duced by that or as. e.g. He wore the same suit that I had see n him in five years before.  He ate his sandwiches at midday in the same places as I did.  You havent changed I said smiling. He had the same ab - surd appearance that I remembered.  Same may also be followed by a phrase introduced by as. e.g. Saying good -bye my aunt gave me the same warning as on  the day of my fathers departure.  His head was disproportionally large built on the same lines  as his sisters but with finer features.   17. Same is sometimes found as part of set phrases. Here  are some of the m e.g. Its all the same to me. It makes no difference to me.  I asked him what he wanted to start with. It was all the  same to him. it made no difference to him.  I dont think hell wish to see me. But Ill come all the same.  in spite of that  How is he today? Much the same. not apparently differ - ent Indefinite Pronouns   18. The indefinite pronouns express various degrees and var - ious kinds of indefiniteness. We find the following subgroups  among them  1 indefinite pronouns proper  a some  any no  b somebody anybody nobody  someone anyone no one  something anything nothing  c one none  2 distributive pronouns  a all every each other either neither both  b everybody everyone everything  3 quantitative pronouns  much many little fe w a little a few a lot of lots of  a great deal a great many etc.  19. The pronoun some may be used as an adjective pronoun  and as a noun pronoun. It has several meanings. Some usually ex - presses an indefinite number or amount or indefinite quality . e.g. On such days my mother would give me some pennies to buy  sweets or a magazine.  They did give us some nice things to eat didnt they?  I was terrified that some disaster was waiting for me.  I had been playing cricket with some of the neighbouring  children.  The visitor asked me to describe some of the work we do in  our laboratory.  Some used with a singular countable noun may mean a par - ticular but unidentified person or thing.  e.g. Some boy had written a Latin word on the blackboard.  We must firs t think of some plan.  Some is very often used for contrast. Then it is strongly stressed.  e.g. I enjoy some music but not much of it.  Some of us agree with the statement some disagree.  Some may also mean approximately  e.g. It happened some twenty year s ago.  When used as a noun pronoun some may be singular or plu - ral. It depends on whether some refers to countable or uncount - able nouns.  e.g. Some of his opinions were hard to accept.  Some of the food was packed in waterproof bags.  As a rule some is used in affirmative sentences see the exam - ples above. In interrogative and negative sentences it is changed  into any or no see  20 -21 below. However there are instances  when some remains unchanged in interrogative and negative sen - tences. It happe ns when the question or negation does not concern  the part of the sentence containing some i.e. when the part of the  sentence containing some remains affirmative in meaning.  e.g. May I give you some more tea?  I could not answer some of his questions.  Did you see some of his poems published in the magazine?  Im going away for a week. So I shant be able to see some  interesting games.  Not all your answers are correct. Some are some arent.  You know some women cant see the telephone without taking  the rece iver off.   20. The pronoun any is also used as an adjective pronoun  and as a noun pronoun. In affirmative sentences any means it  does not matter who what or which.  e.g. Come any day you like.  I was interested in any new prospect of change.  Any who have  questions to ask are requested to do so in writ - ing. Which newspaper do you want me to buy? Any will do.  Her voice carried well in any hall.  Note. Any number of is a set phrase meaning a great many  e.g. I have any number of plants in my garden.  In interrogative and negative sentences any is used instead of some.  e.g. Is there any chance of seeing any of his pictures?  I did not see any change in his life.  They asked him for some money. He said he didnt have any.  It should be noted that a negative meaning may be conveyed  in the sentence not only by not but also by never without sel - dom hardly etc. It may also be expressed in another clause.  e.g. He never had any luck.  He went away without saying good -bye to any of us.  Now that he lived in the country he seldom had any visitors.  The Dutchman spoke French with hardly any accent.  No one is under any obligation to you.  I dont think any of us ought to wish the result to be different.  Any is used when some doubt or condition is implied. This of - ten occurs in object clauses introduced by if or whether or in con - ditional clauses.  e.g. Let me know if you hear any news.  I wonder if you have met any of these people before.  If you have any news call me up right away.  If you still have any of my father s letters send them to me  please.  Any may be used as an adverbial modifier of degree in the sen - tence.  e.g. He isnt any better.  In spite of your advice she isnt any the wiser.   21. The pronoun no is negative in meaning and used only as  an adjective p ronoun. It may mean not any or not a.  e.g. He had no tie on.  They have no friends in London.  He had no desire to take decisions.  There are no letters for you today.  I have no money left.  There were no people in the hall.  No boy at the school had ever s een the sea.  He is no hero.  The girl was no beauty.  The old man was no fool.  Note the set phrase to be no good.  e.g. He is no good as a pianist       22. There are the following compound pronouns formed with  some - any - and no- someone   anyone   no one  somebody   anybody   nobody  something   anything   nothing  They are all used as noun pronouns and the rules for the use  of some any and no in different kinds of sentences hold good for  them see  19 -21 above.  The compounds in -one and in -body are singular in meaning  and can be used only of persons  e.g. There is someone in his office. Do you hear them talking?  Hed told my landlady he was looking out for someone to  paint him.  My mother wanted me to give more money to the fund than  anyone in the form.  Is there anyone at home?  No one was in a hurry. No one seemed to think that to - morrow existed.  I found my mother in the kitchen. There was no one else at  home.  Somebody must have been using my books. Theyve got all  misplaced on the shel f. Anybody can see that the whole thing has been a failure.  Did you meet anybody on your way home?  Nobody can help him under the circumstances.  The compounds in -one and in -body can have the form of the  genitive case.  e.g. He isnt going to be in anybody s way at this hour of the night.  Did you take anybodys photograph at the party?  Note. When the compounds in -one and in -body are followed by else the geni - tive case suffix -s is added after else. e.g. Thats not my hat. Its somebody elses.  The diffe rence between the compounds in -body and those in   one is that the latter are as a rule more individualizing i.e. the  compounds in -body refer to persons collectively whereas those in  one refer to individuals.  Cf. Somebody is sure to get interested in  the job. some people  one or more persons  This is a letter from someone interested in the job. some  person one person  Nobody knew about her arrival.  no people  No one had come to meet her.  not a person  As a result the compounds in -body are never followed by an  of-phrase while the compounds in -one sometimes are.  e.g. Does anyone of you correspond with her family?  The compounds in -thing can be used only of things. They are  also singular in meaning but they cannot have the form of the  genit ive case.  e.g. There is something wrong with him.  We were almost outside our house before I took in that some - thing was not right.  Why dont you say something? he demanded.  Ill do anything for you.  Is there anything in the paper? he said as we appr oached  the end of our silent meal.  Nothing could remove his disappointment.  The doctor could suggest nothing to me.  The doctor could  not suggest anything to me.  He looked at me and didnt say anything.  Dirk never concealed anything.  Let me see your pic tures. If theres anything I like Ill buy it.  Note the idiomatic use of something in the following sen - tences  e.g. He is something of a hermit.     -   - .  I hope to see something of you during the holidays.   -      ...   is something in the Foreign Office.   -  -      .  Something  or other  prevented  him from  coming .          .  -    .  Its something like two miles to the lake. approximately  Ill whistle the tune for you. It goes something like this.      All the compound indefinite pronouns may be modified by ad - jectives which are generally placed in post -positio n to their head - words.  e.g. You should do something sensible about it at last.  Somebody important has arrived Im sure.  I want someone reliable to do this work.  I thought he was going to tell me something painful.  I thought Id come and see if they had a nything new.   23. The pronoun one in all of its uses refers exclusively to  persons or things that are countable.  The pronoun one is used as a noun pronoun and as an adjec - tive pronoun.  As a noun pronoun it can have the plural form ones and the  form of the genitive case ones. Besides as has been said above  see  8 above the reflexive pronoun oneself is formed from it.  As an adjective pronoun one is invariable.  One has many various uses in English.  1 It is used to stand for people or I or any per son in my po - sition. In other words it refers to nobody in particular.  e.g. One cant be too careful in matters like this.  He was very young not more than twenty -three or four as  indeed one could see at a glance.  The sea was so smooth so luminous tha t when one stared at  it for long one could no longer distinguish for a moment  or two the shape of things.  His sincerity excited ones sympathy.  Its not what I should have chosen for my last years but one  no longer makes ones life when one is old. Life  is made  for one.  Note. Care should be taken not to use one too often in the sentence because it  would make the sentence stylistically clumsy see the last example above.  For example the sentence When one is given ones choice of courses of action  any o f which would be to ones disadvantage one often has difficulty in deciding  what one ought to do should be better expressed in either of the following ways  a When someone is given his choice of courses of action any of which would be  to his disadvantage he often has difficulty in deciding what he ought to do.  b When you are given your choice of courses of action any of which would be to  your disadvantage you often have difficulty in deciding what you ought to do.  Note that you in the last sentence above a pplies to no particular person and is  used with indefinite meaning in which it is more common than the pronoun one. See also Pronouns  3. 2 One may have the meaning of a person.  e.g. He is not one to be easily frightened.  He is not one to fall for  her charms.  One who paints ought to know a lot about perspective.  There was a look in his eyes of one used to risking his life.  Do you want to be the one to spoil all that?  3 One is often used for contrast with other in which case it  preserves some of i ts numerical meaning.  e.g. The brothers are so alike that I sometimes cannot tell one  from the other.  By the way here are the two duplicate keys to the gate   Ill take one the other key youd better keep yourself.  She smiled as one intellectual to anot her. According to Jim life was one damn thing after another.  4 One in combination with nouns denoting time is used to  express some vague time.  e.g. One day hell understand his mistake.  Ill speak to him one of these days.  One Friday night my mother an d father talked for a long  time alone.  One summer evening I went for a stroll in the park.  5 One is used with the meaning of only or single.  e.g. Your father is the one man who can help you now.  This is the one thing we can feel certain about.  This is  the one way to do it.  No one man can do it.  6 Last but not least one is used as a prop -word i.e. as a sub - stitute for a previously mentioned noun. It helps to avoid the rep - etition of the same noun.  e.g. Trams were passing us but my father was not i nclined to  take one.  Will you show me your pictures? I might feel like buying one.  If the prop -word one is preceded by an adjective an article  must be used with it.  e.g. No thats not their car. Theirs is a blue one.  The new vicar was less cultivated tha n the old one.  The prop -word one can be used in the plural.  e.g. I prefer red roses to white ones.  Which biscuits would you like? The ones with chocolate  on them.  The prop -word one ones may also be used in combination with  other pronouns such as this these that those which each ev - ery and other as well as ordinal numerals e.g. first second etc..  e.g. If you will take this chair Ill take that one.  Ive never seen such big tulips as these ones.  Here are some books for you to read. Which  one would you  choose?  There were several houses in the street each one more ex - pensive than the other.  If you dont like this magazine take another one.  My house is the first one on the left.  There are certain restrictions on the use of the prop -word one a one is not used after own  e.g. I wont go by your car. Ill use my own.  b one is normally not used after a superlative or comparative  adjective preceded by the definite article  e.g. The English climate is often said to be the most unpre - dictable  in the world.  Of all the runners my brother was the swiftest.  Of the two armchairs I chose the harder.  Note. Note that the prop -word one is possible when most is used in the mean - ing of very extremely.  e.g. His collection of stamps is a most valuabl e one.  c one is not used after cardinal numerals  e.g. I have only one friend but you have two.  d one is to be avoided in formal or scientific English.  Note the idiomatic uses of one in the following sentences  e.g. He was a man that was liked by one and  all.  by everybody  The sky was gently turning dark and the men began to de - part one after the other.  in succession not together  Would you like me to bring them one by one sir?  singly  one at a time not together  No I wont go with you. For one thing I am very busy at  the moment.  for one reason  The little ones always know a good man from a bad one.   children  It isnt the pretty ones that make good wives and mothers.   pretty girls   24. The pronoun none is a noun pronoun. It is neg ative in  meaning indicating not one or not any and can be used of persons  cf. no one as well as of things countable and uncountable cf.  nothing. The verb following it may be singular or plural accord - ing to the sense required.  e.g. None of us knows where he is going to work.  None of them are any use to me.  None of them really know how ill she is.  We discovered that none of his promises was kept.  He asked them for advice. None was given.  I wanted some more coffee but none was left.  Note. The differenc e between none and the negatives no one nobody and noth- ing is easily brought out with the help of questions. No one nobody is used in an - swer to a who-question.  e.g. Who are you speaking to? No one nobody  Nothing is used in answer to a what -question  e.g. What are you doing there? Nothing  But none is used in answer to a how many - or how much -question.  e.g. How many fish did you catch? None  How much petrol is there in the car? None  How much progress did he make? None   25. The pr onoun all can be used as a noun pronoun and as  an adjective pronoun.  All used as a noun pronoun is singular when it means every - thing the whole of a thing.  e.g. Alls well that ends well proverb  I dont find any change here all looks as it always  did.  He has lost all.  Some day his pictures will be worth more than all you have  in your shop.  All used as a noun pronoun is plural when it means eve - rybody the total number of persons animals or things.  e.g. All are welcome.  All agree that he has behaved splendidly.  All of us think so.  He made a few suggestions. All of them were acceptable.  When all is used as an adjective pronoun the verb may be sin - gular or plural depending on the noun modified by all. e.g. All the money was spent.  All that bu siness fills me with disgust.  All the trunks are packed ready to go.  All students should register before October 1st. There are a few peculiarities in the use of all 1 When all is followed by a noun there is no preposition be - tween them.1 e.g. He worke d hard all time he was here.  I dont like to speak before all these people.  All my friends were happy to hear the news.  All boys prefer playing games to going to school.  However when all is followed by a personal pronoun the  preposition of must be used.  e.g. He has written three novels and all of them were best sellers.  All of us were disappointed by him.  Note. In American English nouns following all are often joined to it like per - sonal pronouns with the help of the preposition of. e.g. All of our students have registered.  All of these books are mine.  2 Note the possible place of all with nouns a and personal  pronouns b used as the subject of the sentence.  e.g. a All the students found the lectures helpful.  The students all found the lectures hel pful  b All of them found the lectures helpful.  They all found the lectures helpful.  3 All may be followed by an appositive clause which is usually  introduced by the conjunction that or asyndetically.  e.g. Meeting George was the first piece of pure chanc e that affect - ed all that I did later.  1 For the use or absence of the definite article after all see Articles 10 Note.   She listened to all that he said with a quiet smile on her lips.  Note the following idiomatic uses of all e.g. He is all in .  He is completely exhausted.  It was all my fault.  entirely  The money is all gone.  completely  He was all covered with mud.  wholly  I did not understand it at all.  in the least degree  After all people laughed at Manet though everyone no w knows he was a great painter.  I warn you once and for all that this foolishness must stop.   for the last and only time   26. The pronoun every is used only as an adjective pronoun.  It modifies singular countable nouns when there are more than  two ob jects of the same description.  e.g. After the gale every flower in the garden was broken.  Every head turned to look at them as they progressed slowly  up the aisle.  He knew by heart every word in her letter.  Every morning the landlady greeted him with the s ame ques - tion Had a good sleep dear?  Every time I ring you up I find you engaged.  He had every reason to believe that he was right.  Note the idiomatic uses of every in the following sentences  e.g. Every other house in the street was damaged in an ai r-raid.   every second fourth sixth etc. house about half the  houses  He comes here every three days.  every third day  They had a rest every few miles.  They had a rest every  time they had walked a few miles.  Every is a synonym of all when the l atter is used attributive - ly. The use of every is however more restricted than that of all because it cannot be used with uncountable nouns.  With countable nouns their use appears to be parallel.  e.g. The explosion broke all the windows in the street.  The explosion broke every window in the street.  Yet in addition to the fact that every precedes singular nouns  and all is associated with plural nouns there is a difference in  meaning. The distinction between all and every is that in a sen - tence like All the boys were present we consider the boys in a  mass in the sentence Every boy was present we are thinking of  the many individual boys that make up the mass. Nevertheless it  is more usual to use every instead of all where possible.   27. There are the following compound pronouns formed with  every everyone   everybody   everything.  All of them are used as noun pronouns and take a singular  verb. Everyone and everybody can be used only of persons.  e.g. Everyones got a right to their own opinion.  She took  the initiative and herself spoke to everyone she knew.  Everybodys afraid arent they? he said looking at the peo - ple around.  Both everyone and everybody can have the form of the gen - itive case  e.g. Hes sure of everyones consent.  The difference in  meaning between everyone and everybody is the same as between someone and somebody see  22 above. Only  everyone can be followed by an of -phrase.  e.g. He is at once physician surgeon and healer of the serious  illnesses which threaten everyone of us in England today.  Note. The compounds with   one are distinct from such groups as every one any  one and some one where one is numerical and refers back to a countable noun that oc  curs in the sentence or the context. These groups are often followed by of -phrases.  e.g. I have three sisters. Every one of them is beautiful.  The book opened to them new worlds and every one of them was glorious.  But he knew that it would not take much for every one of them to start  talking freely.  Give me one of those books   any one will do.  Everything can be used only of things and also takes a sin - gular verb but it cannot have the genitive case form  e.g. No wonder everything goes wrong in this house.  Ill tell you everything tonight.  One cant have everything.   28. The pron oun each is used as a noun pronoun and as an  adjective pronoun. In the former case it is singular in meaning  and takes a singular verb a. In the latter case it is associated  with a singular countable noun and can be used when there are at  least two objec ts of the same description b.  e.g. a I told them what each was to do in case of an emergency  b For years I thought I remembered each detail of that day.  I have met him each time he has come to London.  We examined each specimen minutely.  He gave each b oy a present.  Each as an adjective pronoun is a synonym of every but there  is some difference in meaning between them. Every tends to gath -  er the separate items into a whole each focuses attention on them  individually and so tends to disperse the unity  it takes the mem - bers of a definite group one by one without adding them up. In  other words every refers to a number of individuals or things  considered as a group each refers to a number of individuals or  things considered separately.  e.g. Every o range in the crate was wrapped in tissue paper. He care - fully unwrapped each orange before putting it on the scales.  As a result of its specific meaning each may be followed by  an of -phrase which is not possible in the case of every.  e.g. Each of the me n signed his name as he came in.  111 send each of you some seeds in the autumn.  Each of the ten houses in the row had a garden.   29. The pronoun other can be used as an adjective pronoun  and as a noun pronoun.  As an adjective pronoun it is invariable. W hen it is preceded by  the indefinite article an they are written as one word another.  The other  a singular noun means the second of the two.  e.g. The insurance offices were on the other side of the street.  He pulled on the other glove and said tha t though it was  late he would run along to his office.  I spent half my time teaching law and the other half in Lon - don as a consultant to a big firm.  Another  a singular noun means an additional one a dif - ferent one.  e.g. Young Martin had been  sent on another errand to the grocer.  Richard stayed for another moment shifting from one foot  to the other.  We went into another room.  I must find myself another job.  The other a plural noun means the rest the remaining  e.g. My mother said I dont want my boy to suffer in any way  at the side of the other boys in the form.  When I returned home I found my wife talking to our neigh - bour. The other guests had gone.  Other  a plural noun means additional different re - maining . e.g. I h ave no other friends but you.  We can do as well as other people my aunt said.  He said that he would ring Charles up as soon as he got  home. Then he talked of other things all the way.  Some children like milk chocolate other children prefer plain  chocol ate. As a noun pronoun other has the plural form others and the  genitive case forms others and others.  Other used as a noun pronoun has the same meanings as when  it is used as an adjective pronoun see above  e.g. Simon set one foot slightly in front o f the other ready to  fight.  It was only another of her many disappointments.  If that cigar is too strong try another.  That may be your opinion but the others think differently. I  have talked to them.  All superiors were important to Mr Vesey though some  were  more important than others.  One of his daughters is married to a man who lives by his  pen. The others husband is a doctor.  Note the idiomatic uses of other in the following sentences  e.g. I dont want him to be other than he is. I dont want him  to be different.  She could invent no way of squeezing another nine guineas  out of her budget.  nine guineas more  Another fifty yards farther on you can see Marcellos boat.   fifty yards more  I saw your wife the other day I said.  a few days ag o And somehow or other he had acquired a wide acquaintance  with the less known parts of the city.  in some way that  cannot be accounted for  Some idiot or other has been throwing stones at the dog.   30. The pronoun either and its negative counterpart neither  are used as noun pronouns and as adjective pronouns. When used  as nouns they take a singular verb. Either usually means one or  the other of two.  e.g. Either of these machines is suitable for the work you want  done.  Which of the two rooms would y ou like sir? Oh either. I  dont care.  The news did not shock either of them.  My wife and I watched him make the parcel but he took no  notice of either of us.  Have you seen either of your parents today?  There is a train at 11.30 and one at 12.05. Eithe r train will  get you to Oxford in time for the meeting.  In the above meaning either is mostly used as a noun pronoun  though occasionally it occurs in the function of an attribute see  the last example above.  Either may also mean each of two. In this me aning it is used  as an adjective pronoun and mostly found in literary English.  e.g. He came down the road with a girl on either arm.  There was a lamp at either end of the street.  The houses on either side were tall and big.  Neither means not the one nor t he other.  e.g. That evening my mother spoke with such quiet anger that  Aunt Milly was intimidated. After that neither of them  was ever willing to take up the subject.  The first time we met after the ball neither of us said a  word that was not trivial.  My friend and I came to the end of our last walk. We shall  meet again she said. If not next year then some other  time. Neither of us believed it.  You can keep your astonishment and your mortification for  yourself. I feel neither.  I have travelled by b oth trains and neither train had a res - taurant car.  Neither brother has been abroad.   31. The pronoun both is used as a noun pronoun and as an  adjective pronoun. It is plural in meaning and applied only to two  persons or things.  e.g. Two men were injured  in the accident. Both are now recover - ing in hospital.  I ordered only one of the two books but now I think Ill take  both.  Dirk went up to her and took both her hands.  I made plans for the future that ignored both my parents  and my studies.  I invited o ne of the brothers but both of them came.  Note the possible place of both in the sentence.  e.g. Both the men were interested in the job.  Both these children are mine.  These children are both mine.  Both my children are boys.  Both of them agreed that the m atter had better be dropped.  They both accepted the invitation.  They have both been invited.   32. The pronouns much and many are used as noun pro - nouns and as adjective pronouns.  Much means a large amount. As a noun pronoun it takes a  singular verb. A s an adjective pronoun it modifies only uncount - able nouns  e.g. Much of his life was lived inside himself.  I dont suppose you had much to eat all day said my mother.  You havent much time if you want to catch the train.  I hope you havent brought m uch luggage.  Many means a large number. As a noun pronoun it takes a  plural verb. As an adjective pronoun it modifies only countable  nouns in the plural.  e.g. There were lots of people on the beach. Many of them were  holiday - makers . Im marking the c hildrens compositions. Have you many  left?  I havent many friends now.  You havent made many mistakes this time.  There is a strong tendency in present -day English to use much  and many particularly when they function as adjective pronouns  only in inte rrogative and negative sentences and in object clauses  introduced by if or whether.  e.g. I had not very much advice to give him.  I did not meet many English people who could speak foreign  languages.  Did you have much rain on your holidays?  Do you know many  people in London?  I doubt whether therell be much time for seeing the sights.  The train leaves at six oclock.  I wonder if many people will come to the party.  Thus He has much time although apparently correct gram - matically is hardly ever seen or hear d in present -day English. A  lot of lots of plenty of a great deal of a large number of a  good many a great many and the like replace much and many in affirmative sentences.  e.g. There is a lot of work to do.  I know plenty of boys in other schools had  achieved the same  results as I had.  She knows lots of girls who go out dancing every Saturday.  He has done a great deal of research on the subject.  A large number of people were gathered at the cafe.  My mothers family had been different in a good many wa ys from my fathers.  A great many mistakes have been made by nearly everybody.  Much and many can be used in affirmative sentences in the  following cases  a when they are used as the subject of the sentence or modify it  e.g. Much depends on what answer he will give.  Much of what he says is true.  Many think that the situation will improve.  Much time would be saved if you planned your work properly.  Many people like to spend their spare time working in their  gardens.  b when much and many are modified by a dverbs of degree  e.g. so too as and how  e.g. No I wont do it. Its too much trouble.  There are too many mistakes in your exercises.  You can have as much fruit as you want.  c when much is used alone as a noun pronoun in the function  of an object  e.g. My mother meant much to me.  I would give much to know what he is thinking now.  Note. Occasionally we find such synonymous expressions of much and many as a world of heaps of oceans of and the like. They are used in colloquial English for  emphasis  e.g. I have heaps of news. When can we talk?  Much and many change for degrees of comparison. They are  more and most.  e.g. He made more progress than I had expected.  I found more letters lying on his table that morning.  He knew more about me than I thought.  Mos t work was done in my fathers office.  Most people hold the same opinion as you do. The most I can do for you is to give you a letter of recommendation.  Most of his money came from selling his landscapes.  Most of the delegates voted against the proposal.  Most of his relatives lived in the country.   33 The pronouns little and few are used as noun pronouns  and as adjective pronouns.  Little means a small amount. As a noun pronoun it takes a  singular verb. As an adjective pronoun it is used with uncount - able nouns.  e.g. Little was known of his life when he was alive.  My story was a record of hard work and little adventure.  Few means a small number. As a noun pronoun it takes a  plural verb. As an adjective pronoun it is used with countable  nouns in th e plural.  e.g. Yet few have been found to deny the mans greatness.  Very few decisions were ever taken in that department.  Both little and few have a negative implication   they mean  not enough.  e.g. The shipwrecked sailors had no food and little water.  Few people would agree with you.  A little and a few which are to be treated as set phrases have  a positive meaning. They mean some though not much many.  e.g. He earns a little money and can live quite comfortably on it.  I suggested that he should get  a few grapes and some bread.  Compare  e.g. I know little about painting.  almost nothing  I know a little about painting.  something  There is little change in his appearance.  almost no change  There is a little change in his appearance.  some c hange  Few birds can be seen in that place.  almost none  A few birds can be seen in that place.  some birds  He has few friends and lives a lonely life.  almost none  He has a few friends who call to see him quite frequently.   some friends  Little  and few change for degrees of comparison. Their forms are  little   less  least  few  fewer   fewest  e.g. Please make less noise.  George gives me the least trouble.  There were fewer people in the bus today.  Who has made the fewest mistakes?  Reciprocal P ronouns   34. There are two reciprocal pronouns in English each other  and one another. They show that something is done mutually.  Both pronouns are mainly used in the function of an object di - rect indirect or prepositional in the sentence  e.g. I knew  that my two aunts bitterly disliked each other.  They had come to understand one another   and he  without anything being said.  But he was a little puzzled by the behaviour of Blanche and  Strickland towards one another.  As is seen from the above examples both each other and one another can be used when speaking of two persons. However  when more than two persons are meant only one another is usu - ally used.  e.g. When he entered the cafe he saw the people wink at one an - other.  Each other and one another can be used in the genitive case  e.g. They had not met so long that they had forgotten  each oth - ers names.  In their letters they made it a rule to inquire after one an - others relatives.  Interrogative Pronouns   35. The interrogative pronouns are who whom whose  what which how much and how many. They are all used in form - ing quest ions.   36. The pronoun who asks about persons. It does not dis - tinguish gender or number. It may be masculine or feminine sin - gular or plural in meaning. Who is the nominative case and it is  mainly used as the subject of the sentence.  e.g. Who is comin g with me?  Who are the people over there?  The objective case of who is whom which is used as an object  in the sentence. It may be a direct a or prepositional object b.  e.g. a Whom did you see there?  Whom does he suspect?  b To whom did you give the m essage?  Of whom are you thinking?  By whom was it done?  But whom is the literary form and is preferred in writing. In  conversation it is replaced by who. When who happens to be used  as a prepositional object the preposition is placed at the end of  the sent ence.  e.g. Who did you see there?  Who does he suspect?  Who did you give the message to?  Who are you thinking of?  Who was it done by?  Note the idiomatic uses of who in the following sentences  e.g. It was so dark that I couldnt tell whos who.  could not  tell one person from the other  Youll find his name in Whos Who.  a reference book on  contemporary outstanding people   37. The pronoun whose is a possessive interrogative pro - noun. It is used as an adjective pronoun mostly in the function  of an at tribute though occasionally it occurs as a predicative too.  e.g. Whose room is it going to be?  Whose is the room going to be?  In whose car do you prefer to go? Whose car do you prefer  to go in?   38. The pronoun what may be used as a noun pronoun and  as an adjective pronoun.  When it serves as a noun it asks after things. It may be sin - gular or plural in meaning. It may be used as the subject a pred - icative or an object in the sentence. It has no case forms.  e.g. Whats this?  What are those strange ob jects in the distance?  What is his telephone number?  What is your name?  What do you mean?  About what are you going to ask him?  It should be noted that in the case of a prepositional object it  is more usual to place the preposition at the end of the senten ce in present -day English.  e.g. What are you going to ask him about?  What are you laughing at?  Special attention should be paid to the use of what asking  about a persons profession  e.g. What is the man your father is talking to? He is a lawyer.  Compa re it with a wh-question asking about the identity of a  person.  e.g. Who is the man your father is talking to? He is Mr Clap - perton our new neighbour.  What can also be used in asking about actions  e.g. What are you doing? Im cleaning the car.  Note the idioma tic uses of what in the following sentences  e.g. What is he like? He is tall dark and handsome.    ? What is he like as a pianist? Oh he is not very good.      ...?  Ben suddenly looked at his watch. Wh at about your den - tist? he asked       ? What about a cigarette?    ? What about something to eat?    -- ?  What  of it?     ?  So what ?   ?  Hes a clever fellow he knows w hats what           When what is used as an adjective pronoun it is also in - variable and serves as an attribute to nouns denoting both persons  and things.  e.g. What languages do you know?  What play did you see last?  What m an would have done more?  What feelings do such stories excite?  What artists are going to be exhibited this autumn?  To ask after the kind or sort to which a person or thing be - longs synonymous set phrases what kind of and what sort of are used instead of what.  e.g. What kind of man is he?    ?     ? What sort of chocolate do you like best?       What kind of house have they bought?   What sort of proposition do you want to discuss with me?        What preceding a noun may also be used at the head of an ex - clamatory sentence. This what is sometimes called the exclama - tory what.  e.g. What a stupid thing he has said!  What splendid pictures they have in their collection!  What marvellous news he bro ught!  What fun we had yesterday!   39. The pronoun which is used as a noun pronoun and as an  adjective pronoun. It is used of persons and things and is invari - able in form. It can have the function of the subject an object  and an attribute in the sentenc e. The use of which is more restricted than that of what because  which is selective   it selects one or more out of a definite num - ber of persons or things.  e.g. Which will you have tea or coffee?  Which way shall we go?  Which pen does the cap belong to?  Which author are you more interested in?  Which students have answered all the questions correctly?  As a result of its selective meaning which is often followed b  an of-phrase.  e.g. Which of your friends will you invite to the party?  Which of them said that?  Which of his books are you reading now?  Compare the use of what and which in the following sentences  e.g. What TV programmes do you usually watch? Which of t hem  is your favorite one?  What examinations are you going to take this term? Which  of them do you find most difficult?  What car have you? Which car is yours?   40. The pronouns how much and how many are used as noun  pronouns and as adjective pronouns.  How much asks about the amount of something and is used of  or with only uncountable nouns.  e.g. How much did you find out?  How much money do you need?  How many asks about the number of persons and things and is  used of or with only countable nouns  e.g. There  are several people sitting at the fireplace. How many  can you count?  How many people took part in the experiment?  How many invitations have been sent out?   41. The interrogative pronouns who what and which may be  made emphatic by adding ever. Ever here means something like  on earth in the world. Depending on the situation questions  introduced by the emphatic forms in -ever express different emo - tions such as surprise anger despair indignation etc. The use  of the form in -ever is distinctly  colloquial  e.g. Whoever who ever can be calling at this time of the night?  Whoever who ever heard of such a silly idea?  Whatever what ever were you thinking of to suggest such a  plan?  He gets up at five oclock every morning. What ever for?  Conjun ctive Pronouns  42. The pronouns who whom whose what which how  much how many and that are used to connect subordinate clauses  with the principal clause. Owing to their auxiliary function they  are called conjunctive pronouns. At the same time they al l have  an independent syntactic function in the subordinate clause.  e.g. Do you know who has bought the house? subject  He always said exactly what he thought object  Im surprised to see how much he had done in so short a  time object  I walked past a  row of houses whose front doors opened onto  the pavement attribute  Youll never guess what present I want him to give me. at tribute  I had to find out what he was. predicative  When conjunctive pronouns are used in the function of a  prepositional ob ject the preposition is generally placed at the end  of the clause.  e.g. The man whom I spoke to is my neighbour.  You are the very person that I have been looking for.  Who it was done by is for us to find out.  Conjunctive pronouns may be used to introduc e different  kinds of clauses except adverbial clauses and appositive clauses  which are introduced only by conjunctions.  e.g. What was done cannot be undone subject clause  The question is which of them is going to be appointed presi - dent of the firm predicative clause  Life in the country isnt what it used to be you know pred - icative clause  I dont know whose handwriting it is. object clause  Ill surprise you by what Ill do. prepositional object clause  He is one of the men whom I can trust  attributive clause   43. It is noteworthy that not all the conjunctive pronouns can  be used with all kinds of clauses mentioned above. Thus subject  predicative and object clauses can be introduced by the conjunctive  pronouns who whom whose which  and how much how many.  The use of these conjunctive pronouns does not differ from that  of the corresponding interrogative pronouns see  36 -40 above.  That is no longer a conjunctive pronoun when it introduces one of  these clauses but a mere conjuncti on because it has no syntactic  function in the subordinate clause.  e.g. That he is going to resign is no secret.  My guess is that he is in love.  I know that he is no fool.   44. Attributive clauses can be introduced by who whom  whose which and that. The conjunctive pronouns in this case al - ways refer to some noun or noun equivalent in the principal  clause. That is why they are also called relative pronouns. The  noun they refer to is called their antecedent  The relative pronoun who whom is used only  of persons.  e.g. They were worried about their nephews who were taking part  in the war.  He interviewed several men and engaged one who had been  discharged from the army.  He was a man who meant what he said.  I wish I knew the man who owns that farm.  The ho stess continued the introduction Here is Mr Swift a  tutor and my nephew Maurice whom hes tutoring.  Meg loved her little brother to whom she had been a second  mother.  The relative pronoun whose may be used of both persons and  things.  e.g. We went one  day to the picture -dealer in whose shop my  brother thought he could buy a picture or two.  When it came to literature young Maurice was the one  whose reading in any way compared with Swifts.  There are newspapers in Great Britain whose pages are large - ly filled with news of sport and with stories of film -stars  or accounts of crime and of law -court trials.  The relative pronoun which is used of things.  e.g. She sat down behind the tea tray which the servant had just  brought in.  As I walked up the endless stairs of the house in which  Strickland lived I confess I was a little excited.  She obtained some opinions which later I realized were en - tirely sensible.  She had never owned a dress which her girlfriends would con - sider expensive.  Note. With a collecti ve noun used as the antecedent the relative who is used  when the individuals forming the group are meant and the relative which when the  group as whole is meant.  e.g. He wanted to interview someone from the team who were now resting.  He wanted to intervie w someone from the team which was winning.  Which is also used if the antecedent of the attributive clause  is the whole of the principal clause.  e.g. That day she took her share of the meal which nowadays she  rarely did.  He invited us to dinner which was very kind of him.  The decision was postponed which was exactly what he wanted.  The attributive clauses of the above type are always separated  from their principal clause by a comma see the examples above.  The relative pronoun which in this type of attri butive clauses is  rendered in Russian as . Which preceded by the preposition of is parallel in meaning to  whose when the latter is used of things.  Cf. We crossed the river the current of which was very rapid.  We crossed the river whose current was very rapid.  That is used of both persons and t hings singular and plural.  e.g. You are the very people that Ive been meaning to speak to.  He is not a man that can understand such things.  That was all the education that she had had during her girl - hood.  She had a wit that was irresistible.  The actres s told him of the plays that she had been in and  what parts she had had.  That not who or which or what is used  a after most indefinite pronouns  e.g. Have you got all that you need?  Sylvia had always had everything that she wanted.  There is not much t hat can be done.  Fred looked about the room trying to discover something  that might remind him of Sally.  He never says anything that is worth listening to.  b after nouns modified by an adjective in the superlative de - gree as well as by first or last.  e.g. Yesterday was one of the coldest days that Ive ever known.  He has written the best book that Ive ever read on the sub - ject. It was the first time that he heard of the episode.  c after a noun modified by same  e.g. She wore the same dress that I had seen her in at her sisters  wedding.  d when the antecedent is both a person and a thing  e.g. He talked of the people and the places that he had visited.  Unlike who and which that cannot be preceded by a pre - position.  Cf. This is the letter about which I told you.  This is the letter that I told you about.  Note. When a relative pronoun serves as a prepositional object the following  sentence patterns are possible.  e.g. This is the story of which I spoke.  This is the story which I spoke of.  This is the sto ry that I spoke of.  This is the story I spoke of.  Attributive clauses fall into two groups   non-defining and  defining clauses see Articles  15. That as a relative pronoun  is possible only with defining clauses i.e. attributive clauses that  cannot b e removed from the sentence without destroying its  meaning. Note however that who and which can be used with  both kinds of attributive clauses   defining and non -defining.  e.g. At the time I was reading a book that which I had heard so  much about.  At the time I was reading an interesting book which later on  I gave as a present to my niece.  Id like you to meet the girl that whom Im going to marry.  She is both charming and clever. Id like you to meet the  girl whom you are sure to fall for.  Relati ve pronouns are often dropped in spoken English unless  they perform the function of the subject of the sentence or intro - duce non -defining attributive clauses.  e.g. At the party I saw some people   I knew personally.  The man   I gave up my seat to was very gr ateful.  Is it the paper   you wanted to see?  He went back the wa y         he had come.  NUMERALS   1. Numerals include two classes of words   cardinal and or - dinal numerals.  Cardinal numerals indicate number one two three four ten  twelve eighteen tw enty thirty -three seventy -five ninety -one a  hundred one hundred and forty -six two hundred and twenty - eight a thousand three thousand and fifty -two seven thousand  three hundred and seventeen etc. Note 1. The numerals hundred thousand and million  are always preceded by  the indefinite article a or the numeral one. The latter is generally used when these  numerals are followed by some other numerals e.g. a hundred but one hundred and  twenty three a thousand but one thousand seven hundred and thirty . Note 2 Care should be taken to remember the following patterns  a five hundred books  500 books  b hundreds of books  three thousand cars  3000 cars  thousands of cars  two million workers  2000000 workers  millions of workers.  In the exam ples under a the exact number of persons or things is given in  the examples under b hundred thousand and million do not indicate any exact  number but only a great multitude of persons or things.  Ordinal numerals indicate order first second third fourth  tenth twelfth eighteenth twenty -fifth forty -seventh a hun  dredth two hundred and thirty -ninth etc. For the use of articles with ordinal numerals see Articles  ll. Note 1. Dates are read in the following way  1st September 1944   the first of September September the first  nineteen hundred and forty four 5th January 1807   the fifth of January  January the fifth eighteen hundred and seven.  Note 2. Common fractions are read in the following way   23 two thirds  38  three eig hts 512   five twelfths.  Decimal fractions are read as 3.5  three point five 4.76  four point seventy six   8.03   eight point naught three   2. Both cardinal and ordinal numerals can have certain func - tions of nouns a and of adjectives b in th e sentence.  e.g. a Three of the schoolboys fell ill with scarlet fever.  There were four of us there.  Will you have another cup of tea? No thank you. Ive  had two.  There were three questions in the test. The second was  particularly difficult.  Jane was  the first to wake up.  Which exercise would you like to do first? I think Id  begin with the third.  b We had three visitors that day. The first visitor to arrive  was my aunt Milly.  ADVERBS   1. Adverbs are a miscellaneous class of words which is not  easy to define. Some adverbs resemble pronouns e.g. here there  then where. Others have a lot in common with prepositions e.g.  about since in before over. Still others are derived from adjec - tives e.g. seriously slowly remarkably.  Adverbs have  diverse lexical meanings and differ from each  other in their structure and role in the sentence.  Structurally some adverbs are single words e.g. fast well  clearly somehow nowhere sideways southwards etc. others  are phrases e.g. at last all along at first in front from above  since then till later for once the day after tomorrow all of a  sudden as a result etc..  Most adverbs serve to modify verbs adjectives and other ad - verbs in the sentence.  e.g. He spoke resolutely.  They are com ing here tomorrow.  He has known it all along.  My mother looked somewhat pale.  She knew him very well.  Some adverbs modify whole sentences expressing an evaluation  of what is said in the sentence with respect to either the form of  communication or to its co ntent.  e.g. Briefly there is nothing more I can do about it.  Frankly I am tired.  Still other adverbs have a connective function between what is  being said and what was said before.  e.g. Ive talked to him several times about the matter and yet he does n othing about it.  He however hasnt arrived yet.  The girl seems very intelligent though.  She wouldnt come anyway.  Classification of Adverbs   2. According to their meaning adverbs fall into the follow - ing groups  1 adverbs of time afterwards alrea dy at once eventually  immediately lately now presently soon suddenly then when  yesterday yet etc. e.g. He is coming tomorrow.  He is now in his office.  2 adverbs of frequency always constantly hardly ever never  occasionally often seldom  sometimes three times twice etc. e.g. He is always in time for meals.

It was all rather dark within.  A dog began to bark somewhere inside.  The use of somewhere anywhere and nowhere in different  kinds of sentences is similar to the use of the corresponding in - definite pronouns some any and no see Pronouns  19 -22.  4 adverbs of manner badly clearly deeply fast how quickly  sideways sincerely somehow well willingly etc. e.g. He speaks English well.

Adverbs of degree or intensifiers may be subdivid ed into three  semantic groups  a emphasizers emphasizing the truth of the communication  actually at all clearly definitely indeed just literally plainly  really simply etc. e.g. I really dont know what he wants.  They literally tore his argume nts to pieces.  I simply dont believe you.  I just cant understand it.

My father alone could help me at the time.  b additive again also either equally even too etc. e.g. He didnt answer my letter again.  I too am very busy at the moment.  7 viewpoint adverbs economically morally politically scien - tifical ly weatkerwise etc. Such adverbs are understood to mean  from a moral political scientific point of view.  e.g. Geographically and linguistically these islands are closer to  the mainland than to the neighbouring islands.  Economically the project is bound to fail.  8 attitudinal adverbs which express the speakers comment  on the content of what he is saying. Such adverbs can be of two  kinds  a adverbs expressing a comment on the truth -value of what is  being said indicating the extent to which the sp eaker believes  what he is saying is true admittedly allegedly apparently cer - tainly decidedly definitely doubtless maybe obviously perhaps  possibly presumably probably quite likely supposedly surely un - doubtedly etc. e.g. Perhaps the pu blic does not have much choice in the matter.  Certainly he had very little reason to fear anyone.  b adverbs expressing some attitude towards what is being  said   amazingly cleverly  incorrectly curiously foolishly  unfortunately funnily enough  unhappily incredibly ironical - ly unjustly unluckily oddly preferably reasonably remark - ably sensibly significantly strangely tragically typically unex - pectedly etc. e.g. He is wisely staying at home tonight.  Naturally we were extre mely annoyed when we received the  letter.  9 conjunctive adverbs above all accordingly alternatively  anyhow anyway as a result at any rate besides by the way  consequently  finally firstly for all that for example further  furthermore henc e however incidentally in other words in spite  of that instead in that case lastly likewise meantime mean  while namely nevertheless next on the contrary on the one oth - er hand otherwise rather secondly similarly so still that is  then therefore though thus too yet etc. e.g. Id like you to do two things for me. First phone the office  and tell them Ill be late. Secondly order a taxi to be here  in about half an hour.  Incidentally he left you a message. It is on your desk.  I didnt like the food there.

Let me have a look at the picture please.   3. The adverbs when where how and why belonging to dif - ferent semantic groups mentioned above have one point in com - mon  they serve to form questions and introduce some kinds of  subor dinate clauses. In the former case owing to their auxiliary  function they are called interrogative adverbs a. In the latter  case also owing to their auxiliary function they are called con - junctive adverbs b. In both cases they perform different ad ver- bial functions in the sentence.  e.g. a When did you see him last? adverbial modifier of time  Where are you going? adverbial modifier of place  How did you manage it? adverbial modifier of manner  Why didnt you tell me about it? adverbial modifi er of  cause  b Sunday was the day when he was least busy adverbial  modifier of time  The thing to find out was where he was then adverbial  modifier of place  How it was done remains a mystery to me. adverbial modi - fier of manner  I wanted to know w hy he had left us so abruptly adverbi - al modifier of cause  As is seen from the above examples the conjunctive adverbs  can introduce attributive predicative subject and object clauses.  The adverb how in addition to the above functions can also  be placed at the head of an exclamatory sentence. In this case it is  often followed by an adjective or an adverb but it may also be  used alone. This how is sometimes called the exclamatory how.  e.g. How unfair grown -ups are!  Oh how the baby cries!  Forms of Ad verbs   4. A considerable number of adverbs are formed from adjec - tives by adding -ly e.g. calm   calmly slow   slowly kind  kindly etc. Spelling notes  a adjectives ending in -y change it to -i e.g. gay  gaily  busy   busily happy   happily but dry  drylydrily  b adjectives ending in -ableible drop the final e and add -y e.g. capable   capably suitable   suitably sensible   sensibly etc c adjectives ending in -l double it e.g. skilful   skilfully final  finally beautiful   beautifully.  But adverbs cannot be formed from adjectives already ending  in -ly such as manly friendly silly lively fatherly etc. An ad - verbial phrase is used in this case instead of an adverb e.g. in a silly way in a friendly manner etc. Some adverbs however have the same form as the corre - sponding adjective.  e.g. He walked very fast.  The road runs straight for miles.  He got up very early.  He didnt try hard enough.  I didnt wait for him long.  He spelled my name wrong.  Some other adverbs have two forms the a djective form and  the form in -ly. In most cases the two forms differ in meaning.  e.g. He came late.  I havent seen him lately.  The time is drawing near for our departure.  I nearly missed my train.  He works hard.  He hardly ever works.  It is pretty early.  She was prettily dressed.  There is also a group of adverbs with which the form without  -ly is mainly found in set phrases where it often undergoes some  change of meaning.  e.g. They travelled cheaply.  He bought sold got the car cheap.  She brushed the flo or cleanly.  The bullet went clean  right through his shoulder.  He spoke loudly and clearly.  Stand clear of the door.  Keep clear of the painted wall.  He shut the door closely.  He followed close behind.  Keep close to me.  He loved his daughter dearly.  He sold bought it dear.  It cost him dear.  He paid dearly for it.  He found his way easily.  Take it easy.  Go easy about it.  They never treated him fairly at school.  You must play fight fair.  They criticized my work freely.  People are admitted to the museum  free.  I firmly believe that he can be made to see our point.  I shall stand firm.  They thought spoke highly of him.  The plane flew high.  He paid high for his mistake.  He spoke sharply to me.  But Turn sharp to the right.  He will arrive shortly.  It happe ned shortly before the war.  He cut me short.  I saw him stop short and then walk back.  The car passed slowly.  Go slow about it.  The books were tightly packed in the crate.  Hold tight.  They differ widely in opinions.  He was wide awake.  His eyes were wide open. In a few cases both forms can be used with little if any dif - ference in meaning.  e.g. He talked loudloudly.  He turned the idea down flatflatly.  He drove the car slowslowly.  He came back quickquickly.  Note 1. Care should be taken to remember that after the link -verbs to feel to  smell to taste etc. only adjectives are used as predicatives.  e.g. He felt happy.  She is feeling bad well.  The flowers smelled sweet.  The medicine tastes bitter.  Note 2. After certain intransitive verbs we find both adj ectives and adverbs  e.g. The wind blew strongly.  The sun shone brightly.  They stood motionlessly.  They sat weary wearily on the porch.  They lay silently on the grass.  Note 3. There are a few adjectives and adverbs in English which have the same f orm in -ly. They have been derived from nouns e.g. daily weekly monthly hourly etc. e.g. It was his daily duty to water the flowers.  Most newspapers appear daily.  Degrees of Comparison   5. Most adverbs are invariable. But certain adverbs of man - ner change for degrees of comparison. The degrees of comparison  of adverbs are formed in the same way as those of adjectives.  Monosyllabic adverbs and the adverb early form the com - parative and the superlative degrees by adding the suffixes -er and -est. e.g. hard   harder   hardest  soon   sooner   soonest  early   earlier   earliest  The degrees of comparison of all other adverbs are formed by  placing more and most before them.  e.g. beautifully - more beautifully   most beautifully  cleverly   more cleverly   most cleverly  A few adverbs have irregular degrees of comparison.  e.g. well  better   best badly   worse   worst  much   more   most  little   less  least  Note that it is only the comparative degree of adverbs that is  actually found in English.  e.g. He ran  faster than the wind.  Little Martha danced even more beautifully than her sister.  In the combinations most successfully most wisely and the  like most is an adverb of degree denoting very. It is only the  superlatives best most worst and least that ar e actually used.  e.g Johns sister Marian was very nice to me and I liked her  best of them all.  None of us played well but Tom played worst that day.  Syntactic Functions of Adverbs   6. Adverbs may modify single words phrases and sentences.  When they m odify verbs they can serve as adverbial modifiers of  time frequency place manner and degree.  e.g. He was then only fifteen years old. time  During my walks I occasionally met people I knew frequency  I went back inside place  I loved her passiona tely degree  The father held the boy tightly in his arms manner  When adverbs modify adjectives or other adverbs they serve  as adverbial modifiers of degree as intensifiers.  e.g. My English was too poor to allow me to make speeches.  I led a very ple asant life there.  She left the room so quickly.  Its going to rain pretty soon.  Adverbs of degree can also modify certain kinds of prepositional  phrases.  e.g. They lived nearly on the top of the hill.  Im almost through with my work.  His remarks were not quite to the point.  There are a few adverbs in English which can function as at - tributes modifying nouns.  e.g. He was fully master of the situation.  She was quite a child.  Can you see the man over there?  Nobody could explain the noise backstage.  Note. In some combinations the adverbs modifying a noun become adjectivized  e.g. the then Prime Minister in the above examples in after years and some others.  Some groups of adverbs namely viewpoint attitudinal and  formulaic ones modify whole sentences.  e.g. H e felt sure that politically the proposal might have serious  consequences.  Luckily I came just in time.  Will you kindly step aside?  Conjunctive adverbs connect what is being said with what was  said before establishing between two or more statements rel ations  of enumeration equality contrast result inference replacement  concession opposition time and the like.  e.g. He felt ill yet he didnt stay in.  Paul went away for three days. Meanwhile his family were to do the packing.  He got wet in the ra in and fell ill as a result.  I know you are not a doctor. Nevertheless still you could  have bandaged his cut.  Place of Adverbs in the Sentence   7. There are generally four possible positions for adverbs in  the sentence  1 at the head of the sentence  2 betw een the subject and predicate or if the predicate is a  complicated form the adverb appears after the first auxiliary  verb link -verb or a modal verb  3 before the word the adverb modifies  4 at the end of the sentence.  Different semantic groups of adverbs te nd to appear in differ - ent positions.  Thus many adverbs of time and frequency prefer Position 2. e.g. Mother is now busy in the kitchen.  He will soon be back.  He never sleeps late.  She is already typing the letter.  He can sometimes be seen in the library . However some of time adverbs appear in Position 4. e.g. He arrived yesterday.  He hasnt called yet. I havent heard from him lately.  If any adverbs of time and frequency are found in positions  other than those characteristic of them it means that these  ad- verbs are intended for special emphasis.  Cf. He usually comes early common  Usually he comes early emphatic  They are never ready in time common  They never are ready in time emphatic  Adverbs of place and direction usually occur in Position 4. e.g. The young people were enjoying themselves outside.  On Sunday they didnt go anywhere.  Adverbs of manner commonly appear in Position 4 after the  predicate verb.  e.g. They welcomed us warmly.  He explained the problem very simply.  His uncle supported  him lavishly.  Some adverbs of manner may occasionally be found in Position 2. e.g. She knew she had deeply hurt her husband.  The girl bent down and gently scooped the butterfly into the  palm of her hand.  Occasionally adverbs of manner may be found in Posi tion 1. In that case the adverb does not only modify the predicative verb  but also the subject.  e.g. Stiffly she began to get out of the car.  she was stiff when  she began to get out of the car  Anxiously she watched the butterfly.  she felt anxious  when she watched the butterfly  Adverbs of degree or intensifiers are usually placed in Posi - tion 3 before the word they modify.  e.g. I quite forgot her birthday.  He definitely saw me in the corridor.  It was a really stupid thing to do.  I know almost nothing about it.  He came back so soon.  The adverb enough when it modifies an adjective or an ad - verb is placed in post -position to them.  e.g. He is old enough to understand it.  He spoke frankly enough.  However adverbs of degree intensifiers if they m odify  verbs may also be found in Position 4 at the end of the sentence.  e.g. I dont know him well.  He ignored me completely.  Focusing adverbs occupy Position 3  most of them precede  the word they refer to a and only some of them follow it imme - diately b.  e.g. a Shall we just exchange the books?  It was only proper that the girl should give up her seat to  an elderly lady.  He also bought a can of raspberry j am. b Ann alone knew my secret.  I too want a cup of tea.  Viewpoint adverbs are usually found in Position 1 and marked  off by a comma.  e.g. Morally they have won a victory.  Theoretically I have no objection to his proposal.  Note. A change in the positi on of an adverb may bring about a change in its  meaning.  Cf.   The expedition was planned scientifically an adverb of manner meaning us- ing scientific methods  Scientifically the expedition was a success a viewpoint adverb meaning from  a scientifi c point of view  You may answer the question generally an adverb of manner meaning not in  detail  You generally answer the questions in too much detail an adverb of frequency  meaning usually  Attitudinal adverbs mainly tend to appear in Position 1 at the head of the sentence a they may also occur in Positions 2 and 4 b. e.g. a Perhaps they knew that she was coming today.  Unfortunately we didnt find him in the office.  Honestly we knew nothing about it.  b My brother unaccountably had ver y few friends.  It was possible of course that Meg would deny everything . I honestly dont remember it.  Conjunctive adverbs may be found in Positions 1 2 and 4. e.g. She did not expect her husband to meet her. However when  the train had stopped she saw h im standing on the plat - form.  She felt she ought to find a job. She was nevertheless too tired to do it.  The corridor was full of people anyway. Besides he was too  exhausted to wait.  The Adverb so  8. Note the peculiarities in the use of the adverb so. It is generally used as an adverb of degree or a conjunctive adverb but  may also be used to stand for a previous statement. This is found  in the following cases  1 When so is used to express agreement with a preceding  statement especially after the verb s to be afraid to believe to ex - pect to imagine to hear to say to suppose to tell to think. Com - pare it with the pronoun it when it is used instead of a previous  sentence or clause or phrase. For this see Pronouns  5.  e.g. Will he do it? I think so. I expect so. I believe so.  Is he ill? Im afraid so.  Are we on the right road? I hope so.  Why do you say so?  Disagreement with a previous statement may be expressed in  two ways by using not after an affirmative verb or by using so after a negative verb. Only the first way is possible with the  verbs to hope and to be afraid.  e.g. Can you come and see us tomorrow? Im afraid not.  Will you have to do it yourself? I hope not.  As to the other verbs both ways are possible with them the  second being more common however.  e.g. Will they ask you to do it? I dont think so.  Are your parents going to stay with you when they come?  I dont suppose so.  2 When so expresses agreement and refers to a previous  statement it is also  found in the following two patterns  e.g. a It was hot yesterday. So it was.  Weve all worked well. So we have.  b Its going to rain soon. If so what are we going to do?  Im afraid Ive lost my purse. If so how are you going  to get home ? 3 When so is used with to do to refer to a preceding verb.  e.g. I told him to come and see me the next day and he did so.  If they want me to help you I will do so.  4 When so meaning also is used in the following sentence  patterns  e.g. My wife li kes having visitors and so do I.  My brother is fond of pop -music and so is his wife.  The negative counterpart of that is neither.  e.g. I havent seen him for a long time and neither have they.  The Adverbs already and yet  9. Already is generally found in affirmative sentences  e.g. Theyve already left. Theyve left already.  In interrogative sentences it is used with an element of sur - prise or if one is sure of a yes -answer.  e.g. Have they left already?     ? Yes a minute  ago.  Yet is fo und in negative sentences and in interrogative sen - tences when the speaker really does not know the answer.  e.g. They havent left yet. They havent yet left.  Have they left yet?  The Adverbs still and yet  10. Still may be used in all kinds of sentence s with an im - plication of an action positive or negative continuing.  e.g. He is still asleep.    .  Is he still asleep?     ?  is still not asleep.      . Yet may also be used in all kinds of sentences with an im - plication that an action positive or negative has not started yet.  e.g. He is asleep  yet.    .  Is he asleep  yet?    ?   is not asleep  yet.    .  Compare also the following pairs  Do it while it is still light      Do it while it is light yet.      Is it still light ?   ?  Is it light yet?     ? It is still not light.    . It is not light yet.     . The Adverbs much far and long   ll. The use of the adverb much is similar to the use of the  indefinite pronoun much it is mainly found in interrogative and  negative sentences see also Pronouns  32.  e.g. He doesnt care much what happens to him.  Did he travel much?  The adverbs far far off far away and long are also mainly  used in interrogat ive and negative sentences. Their counterparts  for affirmative sentences are a long way a long way off a long  way away and a long time respectively  e.g. Did you have to walk far?  Ive got a long way to go.  I couldnt stay there long.  He talked with us f or a long time.   12. Special attention should be paid to a striking point in the  use of English adjectives and adverbs what a Russian student of  English would expect to find expressed by an adverb modifying the  predicate verb Cf.       . is replaced  in English by an adjective modifying a noun in the sentence.  e.g. He gave a careful look round the room.  He looked round  the room carefully.  He pays us occasional visits.  He visits us occasionally.  His friends shrugged cynical  shoulders.  His friends shrugged  their shoulders cynically.  PREPOSITIONS   1. Prepositions are structural words which are used with a  noun or a noun -equivalent e.g. a pronoun or an ing-form to show  its relation to some other word in the sentence a verb another  noun an adjective and occasionally an adverb.  e.g. The face of his visitor was so distasteful to him that he  could scarcely bear to look at it  The stream was very shallow because of the drought but still  it was active hurrying over the pebbles.  The question thrown at her so vehemently took from her  the power of thought for a moment.  They agreed to his proposal independently of each other.  Prepositions may be single words e.g. in for below behind  across inside within etc. and a lso phrases consisting of more  than one word e.g. because of thanks to due to in front of ow - ing to but for etc. Besides there are a large number of combina - tions in English based on the pattern preposition  noun  preposi - tion e.g. in additio n to on top of on account of in view of in  accordance with in contrast with with respect to etc.. They are on  the way to becoming prepositions.  Note. Some ing -forms are also used as prepositions e.g. concerning including etc.  2. Prepositions m ay have a lexical meaning of their own.  e.g. Her sister appeared carrying a wine -glass in which there was  a raw egg with a little sherry on it. The path felt springy beneath his feet.  He dropped into a chair beside his mother.  She arrived before lunch.  Prepositions may indicate position in space or direction e.g.  on in under over at near to into out of from towards etc.  time e.g. after before during for in on at etc. various ab - stract relations e.g. by with at on for agains t because of in - stead of owing to according to etc..  Most prepositions are polysemantic.  e.g. Ive been here for two weeks.  Hes brought a letter for you.  Did you pay him for his work?  I was punished for my little joke.  They went out for a walk.  They sent for a doctor.  The letters MP stand for Member of Parliament.  But the meaning of prepositions is often weakened and some - times becomes even difficult to trace.  e.g. There is a man waiting for you in your office.  The success of the operation depends entirely on your consent.  Who is responsible for this decision?  There is nothing wrong with him.   3. The choice of prepositions is determined by different fac - tors. Sometimes it is quite free i.e. it entirely depends on the  meaning the speaker wishes to  convey.  e.g. There was a photograph of a young girl on his desk.  There was a photograph of a young girl in his desk.  There was a photograph of a young girl over his desk.  There was a photograph of a young girl under his desk.  But more often the choice of the preposition is determined by  the head -word.  e.g. No one could account for his objection to our plan.  He should be ashamed of himself.  You shouldnt rely on him.  Who is going to look after your children while you are away?  Your brother was cruel to him.  Ive been dependent on both of you so long.  She was treated for diabetes.  He was proud of his elder son.  Everyone is conscious of the change in the man.  He is quite good at painting.  There is no point in arguing.  It is in this case that the meaning of th e preposition often be - comes weakened.  The choice of the preposition may also depend on the noun  that follows the preposition.  e.g. Who was the first to speak at the meeting?  He went there on business.  He is now on a concert tour in Europe.  Im planning t o finish it in February.  He woke up at 8 oclock.  We discussed it in detail.  No one could help him under the circumstances.  In this case the preposition and the noun often become set  phrases e.g. in the evening at dawn by day by taxi etc.. The  meanin g of the preposition is also weakened here.   4. Although prepositions serve to express various relations  between the noun or noun -equivalent following it and other  words in the sentence they sometimes get separated from the  noun or noun -equivalent. T his occurs in  a special questions  e.g. What are you looking for?  Whom did you speak with?  What conclusion did you come to? b certain subordinate clauses  e.g. What he is waiting for is not likely to happen.  That is what he wanted to begin with.  I know whom he is worried about.  Im expecting a letter my plans for the future depend on. c certain passive constructions  e.g. He loved the dogs and they were taken good care of. They found him so ill that a doctor was immediately sent for.  His marriage wa s very much talked about.  d certain functions of the infinitive or infinitive phrase  e.g. He hated to be made fun of. When he retired he went to live in Dorset in a charming  place his wife had bought for him to retire to. You have a lot to be thankful for. Youve done nothing to be ashamed of. There is nothing more to worry about.  Sometimes one and the same noun is associated with two or  more different prepositions. The noun itself need not be repeated  after each preposition and is usually placed after the last one.  e.g. It is a book for and about children.  The pronoun much is used of and with uncountable nouns.  He cared for and looked after his ageing mother.  It follows from the above examples that the prepositions in  this case are retained by the prece ding head -word.   5. The prepositions of by and to may become entirely devoid  of lexical meaning and serve to express mere grammatical rela - tions. This occurs in the following constructions  e.g. Anne was the wife of a miner.  They were followed by their two daughters.  They offered the job to Hawkins.  The prepositions are said to be grammaticalized in this case.  CONJUNCTIONS   1. Conjunctions are structural words that serve to connect  words or phrases as well as clauses or sentences see the examples  below. Conjunctions may be single words e.g. and as because but  or though while etc. phrases consisting of more than one word  e.g. in order that on condition that in case as soon as as  long as for fear that as if as though etc. and als o correlative  conjunctions i.e. conjunctions that are always used in pairs e.g.  as...as both..and either...or not only...but also etc..  Note. Some ing-forms and participles are also used as conjunctions e.g. suppos - ing seeing given  on condit ion if providing or provided.   2. Conjunctions have a lexical meaning of their own.  e.g. He came to see me because he felt happy.  He came to see me though he felt happy.  He came to see me when he felt happy.  He came to see me if he felt happy.  Note. The lexical meaning of the conjunction that is vague. It serves to intro - duce different kinds of clauses.  e.g. That I was not going to be popular with the other children soon became clear to  my parents subject clause  The probability is that he refused t o cooperate predicative clause  He believed that his father was an innocent man. object clause  I was sure that many would follow his example object clause  My father then sold everything that he might have the money for my educa - tion adverbial cla use of purpose  He was so shabby that no decent landlady would take him in. adverbial clause  of result  He agreed with the assertion that his results fell short of the requirements.  appositive clause.   3. According to their role in the sentence conjun ctions fall  into two groups coordinating conjunctions e.g. accordingly and  besides both...and but either..or hence likewise moreover never - theless or still therefore yet etc. and subordinating conjunctions  e.g. after as as..as as l ong as because before if since so that  than that though unless until when whether etc..  Coordinating conjunctions connect words phrases clauses or  sentences which are independent of each other.  e.g. His light -brown hair was fine and thick.  She took a piece of cake and a cup of tea.  She flung the door open and entered.  She felt jealous because there was someone who knew what  was so closely connected with her father and what she  herself had not known.  Meg ordered a fresh pot of tea and they s ettled down to dis - cuss the new complication.  Just now I cant think of anything but of how you were  made to suffer.  She looked scornful but she was secretly pleased.  She could no longer think clearly or speak with decision.  She was furious at me yet I d idnt care.  It was hard to get the story clear from her cousins answers  nevertheless she found out everything.  Subordinating conjunctions serve to join a subordinate clause  to the principal clause.  e.g. When the play was over he asked her if she would le t him see  her home.  He felt marvellously happy as though everything he did were  a marvel.  The two girls were silent till he left the room.  He winked at me as he passed.  The old man said to the boy If you dont like me you may  go home whenever you choose.  Subordinating conjunctions may occasionally introduce a word  or a phrase within a simple sentence.  e.g. When a child he often had to run errands for his elders.  His father was sharp with his children while at home.  He promised to sell the car if necess ary.  There was a dry pungent smell in the air as though of dry  vegetation crisped by the sun.  He looked happy though somewhat tired.  Note. It should be pointed out that a number of conjunctions a have hom - onyms among prepositions b and adverbs c . e.g. a He had not heard himself called that name since his mother died.  b Everything has gone wrong since that night.  c He had his last meal in the restaurant car and hasnt had anything to eat since.   a He found himself in his mothers arms before he saw her . b I talked to him before the conference.  c Ive never seen him so angry before.   a They spoke little until they reached the less busy road.  b He stayed up until dawn reading and writing.   a After he had taken all the things out she started the car.  b After lunch t hey all went to their rooms.  INTERJECTIONS   1. Interjections are words expressing emotions such as sur - prise anger pleasure regret indignation encouragement tri - umph etc. They are used as exclamations.   2. Some interjections are special words which are not associ - ated with any other parts of speech e.g. oh  ah  eh  aha  alas  fie  humph  hum  phew  pshaw  pooh  tush  bravo  hurrah  etc.  Some of these interjections serve to express quite definite feel - ings. Thus alas is a cry of  sorrow or anxiety bravo is a cry of ap - proval meaning well done excellent hurrah is a cry of express - ing joy welcome fie pooh and pshaw express contempt aha expresses triumph.  Other interjections according to the tone of the voice may  expres s emotions of different character e.g. ah may show sorrow  surprise pity pleasure etc. oh is an exclamation of surprise  fear pain etc. phew may express relief astonishment or con - tempt eh  surprise or doubt tush  contempt or impatience  hump h  doubt disbelief or dissatisfaction.   3. There are a number of words which belong to different  other parts of speech but which are also used as interjections e.g.  bother come damn hear hear now there there well why etc. We even find phrases  used as interjections e.g. dear me dear  dear goodness gracious confound it hang it for shame well I  never etc. Some of them like interjections proper serve to express quite  definite feelings. For example bother oh bother are exclamations  of impatience goodness gracious goodness me are exclamations of  surprise damn damn it all damn you confound you and hang it  are used to express anger annoyance for shame serves as a re - proof for not being ashamed of ones actions behaviour well I never expresses surprise and indignation at the same time hear  hear is used as a form of cheering usually to express approval  but it may also be used ironically there there is used to soothe a  person e.g. There there you havent really hurt your self.  Other interjections of this kind may express quite different  feelings according to the tone of the voice or the context.  Thus dear dear or dear me or oh dear express sorrow im - patience or wonder why may be an expression of surprise or pro - test as in Why its quite easy!  Come or come come indicate either encouragement or blame  as in Come cornel Dont be so foolish! or Come comel You dont  expect me to believe it  Now and now now can in different cases serve a different pur - pose Now l isten to met means I  beg you to listen to me Oh come  now! expresses surprise reproof disbelief. Now now or now then  are meant as a friendly protest or warning.  Well depending on the sentence in which it is used may ex - press a variety of emotions. I n Well who would have thought  it? it serves as an expression of surprise. In Well here we are at last!  it expresses relief. Well serves to express expectation in Well  then? Well what about it? resignation in Well it cant be  helped concession in Well it may be true etc. Note. Imitation sounds such as mew cock -a-doodle -doo bang and the like can - not be treated as interjections since they do not serve to express any feeling.   4. Interjections are independent elements which do not per - form any of  the syntactic functions in the sentence. They are usu - ally sentence -words themselves and may be used parenthetically.  e.g. Oh he exclaimed unable to suppress his emotion.  Hm said Mr Fox thoughtfully.  The great poet said The tragedy of our age i s that aesthetic  values do not keep pace with social   and alas technical  developments.  Did you notice the stink in the hall? Well not particu - larly.  Phew! Three times I was nearly sick.  Marian is going to see her old nurse Nannie Robeson in the  afternoon. Confound Nannie Robeson! Marians always  going there.  Oh pooh look at these stockings!  Now Marilyn you dont know what you are doing.  Well... lets walk up there then.  Youre about to make a confession to me. Well dont do it. I  dont want to hear.  Some interjections may be connected with a word in the sen - tence by means of a preposition.  e.g. Hurrah for Jojo and Ed!  Alas for poor Tommy!  Note. Interjections should be distinguished from such one -word sentences as  Helpl Silencel Non sense The latter are notional words not mere exclamations ex - pressing emotions.  NOTES ON THE SYNTACTIC STRUCTURE  OF THE SENTENCE  The Structure of the Simple Sentence  All words in a sentence perform definite syntactic functions.  As a rule every English  sentence contains words or groups of  words functioning as the subject and the predicate. Grammatical - ly these functions are independent and equally significant in the  sentence. For that reason they are called the principal parts  members of the sentenc e. Words performing all other functions in the sentence depend  either on the subject and together they form the subject -phrase  of the sentence or on the predicate together they form the predi - cate-phrase of the sentence.  A sentence which has both the subject and the predicate is  known as a two -member sentence. Most English sentences are  two-member ones.  Sentences which consist of only the subject or only the predi - cate are termed one -member sentences. There are not many one - member sentences in Englis h. We find among them  1 sentences with a verb in the Imperative mood e.g. Keep  clear of the road Step aside please.  2 some exclamatory sentences e.g. What a nice view! How  cold!  3 questions expressing suggestion e.g. Why not give him a  telephone call? Wh at about having a cup of tea?  4 sentences expressing confirmation or negation e.g. Yes. No.  5 some formulas of courtesy e.g. Hello! Good -bye! See you to  night.  Sentences built up of only the subject and the predicate are  called unextended sentences e.g. The rain has stopped. It is cold.  Sentences in which besides the principal parts there are  words performing other secondary functions are called extended  sentences e.g. Edward was most anxious to hear all the news  about his family..  For practical p urposes of learning English it is necessary and  sufficient to distinguish the following syntactic functions within  a simple sentence.  I. The Subject  The subject is a word or a group of words which names the  person object or phenomenon the sentence inform s us about. It  may be expressed by a noun a pronoun a substantivized adjec - tive a numeral an infinitive and an ing -form.  e.g. The stranger came early in February.  Hospitality was a passion with him.  Youre not a bad fellow.  This is my son Henry.  Someo ne was singing an Italian tune.  Much depends on the letter.  What has become of him?  It has been raining since the morning.  Its hard to forget ones past.  The young often complain that the elders do not understand  them.  Two of the letters were from my uncl e. The Dutch are famous for their tulips.  The extraordinary always excites curiosity.  To know all about English is one thing to know English is  quite another.  Watching TV has become his favourite pastime.  II. The Predicate  The predicate is a word or a gro up of words that informs us of  what is happening to the person object or phenomenon indicated  as the subject in the sentence.  The predicate differs from all the other parts of the sentence in  that it relates the information contained in the sentence to re ality i.e.  it is the means of expressing predication and modality for the whole  sentence. For that reason there is only one part of speech that can  function as predicate   it is the verb in one of its finite forms.  A finite verb may be used in this funct ion alone or combined  with other parts of speech. Depending on the structure predi - cates are divided into the following kinds  1 simple verbal predicates   they consist of only a notional  verb in any tense aspect voice or mood form  e.g. His words frightened me. Ive given her every chance.  The heavy luggage had been put in a dry place.  I shouldnt think the idea so unreasonable.  To this kind also belong predicates expressed by phraseological  units and set phrases which are treated as verb equivalent s in this  book.  e.g. They are having breakfast now.  I took a walk as far as the river.  She amuses herself at our expense.  They have been taking care of your children long enough.  2 compound nominal predicates   they consist of a link -verb and a predicativ e  a nominal part commonly expressed by a  noun or an adjective. Other parts of speech may also be some - times found in the function of predicative see below.  The link -verb expresses all the verbal characteristics of the  predicate whereas the nominal p art is the main bearer of mean - ing. The most commonly occurring link -verbs are to be to be - come to get to grow to look to seem to turn.  e.g. He was a mining engineer by profession.  The leaves are turning yellow.  Dave looked surprised.  3 compound v erbal predicates   they consist of a finite form  and a verbal or an adjective. The meaning of the first component  is very pale. It mainly serves as a finite verb and usually express - es the speakers attitude or indicates the positionmotion of the  subject . The meaning of the verbal or the adjective is quite promi - nent and determines the meaning of the whole unit.  As the first component of a compound verbal predicate we find  a modal verbs can may must be to have to shall should  will would ough t to need dare  e.g. You oughtnt to go back on your word.  You should have gone to the concert.  He had to tell the story to his room -mate.  She must have regretted doing it. b verbs of seeming to seem to appear  e.g. He seemed to have heard the news.  For a moment she appeared to be hesitating.  c verbs of unexpected occurrence to happen to turn out to  chance to prove  e.g. They happened to meet at the bus -stop.  He turned out to have no feelings for his nephew.  d some verbs of position and motion  to stand to sit to lie  to be inoutaway to come to go  e.g. He sat staring at the letter.  The boys have gone fishing.  Mother is out shopping.  They stood motionless with their backs to the wall.  III. The Predicative  A predicative  the nominal par t of a compound nominal  predicate may be expressed by a noun an adjective a numeral a  pronoun an infinitive an ing -form and sometimes an adverb.  e.g. He was not an artist but he liked to create artistic things.  It was getting dark.  Henry as usual looked reserved.  The book is very amusing.  We were six in the room.  This suit -case is mine.  My first thought was to ask him for support.  My job was getting it all done in time.  Everybody is in.  IV. The Second Subsequent Action  Expressed by a Verbal  Verb als in this function indicate a second action accompanying the  action of the predicate verb. If transformed the two actions would  form homogeneous predicates connected by the conjunction and.  A second action may be expressed by an infinitive an ing form  and a participle.  e.g. He woke up to see his wife sitting by his bed.  He woke up  and saw...  He walked down the path humming a tune.  He walked...  and hummed...  Having locked the office he started for home.  He locked...  and started...  Dressed he  stood staring at the fire.  He was dressed and  stood...  V. The Subjective Predicative  Words in this function occur after a limited number of verbs in  the Passive Voice see Verbs  192 221 248 Nouns  21  Adjectives  7. They modify the s ubject of the sentence forming  with it a syntactic complex often known as the complex subject.  A subjective predicative may be expressed by a noun a noun  introduced by as an adjective an infinitive an ing-iorm and a  participle.  e.g. He was appointed secretary of the committee.  He was regarded as a promising young writer.  The box was found empty.  He was heard to mention it.  The children were seen running down the lane.  The note was found pinned to the door.  VI. The Objective Predicative  Words in this f unction occur after a limited number of verbs  in the Active Voice see Verbs  193 222 249 Nouns  21  Adjectives  7. They modify the object of the sentence forming  with it a syntactic complex often known as the complex object.  An objectiv e predicative may be expressed by a noun a noun intro - duced by as an adjective an infinitive an ing-form and a participle.  e.g. They appointed him secretary of the committee.  We regarded him as a promising young writer.  I found the box empty.  We thoug ht the game dull.  They heard him mention it.  He saw the children running down the lane.  She had her hair cut very short.  VII. The Object  Objects are words which modify verbs and adjectives. They  complete their meaning indicating the person object or phe - nomenon which the action of the predicate verb affects.  Objects may be expressed by a noun a pronoun a substan - tivized adjective an infinitive and an ing form. There are three  kinds of objects  1 direct   a prepositionless object immediately following  the predicate  e.g. I miss the opera here.  I heard him on the radio.  We did not find anyone there.  I found it difficult to cope with the task.  Do you want to speak with me?  It pained him to think of it.  Im extremely sorry to disturb you.  It was foolish t o speak like that.  They found it difficult to walk in the deep snow.  I usually avoid asking him questions.  She was busy packing upstairs.  It was pleasant lying on the warm sand.  I thought the book worth reading.  2 indirect   a prepositionless object place d between the pred - icate verb and the direct object and indicating the person who is  the receiver of the action.  e.g. They offered Ed a new job.  I lent him my car.  3 prepositional   an object introduced by a preposition.  e.g. He had been waiting for Nor a a long time.  That doesnt depend on me you know.  He was afraid of dogs.  Do you believe in the supernatural?  He is keen on collecting shells.  He thought of going away for the week -end. He was used to having an early breakfast.  VIII. The Adverbial Modifie r Words in this function modify verbs adjectives and adverbs  specifying the circumstances of a happening.  Adverbial modifiers may be expressed by an adverb a noun  with a preposition an infinitive an ing-iorm with a conjunction  or a preposition a part iciple with a conjunction an adjective with  a conjunction and an absolute construction.  According to their meaning adverbial modifiers are sub - divided into  1 adverbial modifiers of place and direction  e.g. He found himself in a lonely street.  The pro cession moved slowly towards the embankment.  Hell be here tomorrow.  2 adverbial modifiers of time  e.g. Ill give you a telephone call tonight.  Bring him back on Sunday.  He kept silent a long time before answering.  When tired he has his supper in his ro om. 3 adverbial modifiers of frequency  e.g. He seldom spoke with such frankness.  She has music lessons twice a week.  4 adverbial modifiers of degree  e.g. He came back home pretty late last night.  The night was very still.  He knows his subject perfectly . 5 adverbial modifiers of manner  e.g. She was crying bitterly.  He came here by taxi.  He opened the door with difficulty.  They walked very fast.  The bus passed us without stopping.  6 adverbial modifiers of attending circumstances  e.g. It is very roman tic to take a walk by moonlight.  I dont feel like going out in this weather.  She looked up at him her face smiling happily.  He lived all by himself in an old house on the river with all  his family gone and forgotten.  I looked round the room the sense of being watched acute  again.  7 adverbial modifiers of description  e.g. Fays eyes continually moved in his Fathers direction as though seeking his approval.  The shop was freshly painted with a large green awning to  protect the window.  He stood there v ery quietly his hand outstretched.  8 adverbial modifiers of purpose  e.g. I did my best to prevent her from making a mistake.  9 adverbial modifiers of cause  e.g. Our flight was delayed owing to the storm.  10 adverbial modifiers of comparison  e.g. She  sat still like a statue.  He was as ugly as a monkey.  Ive got a more difficult problem to solve than find a new  house.  11 adverbial modifiers of consequence  e.g. He had to read only the first ten pages to know what the  book was about.  He was clever enou gh to understand it. I was too tired to go for a walk.  12 adverbial modifiers of concession  e.g. When he returned his wife was still at the table though pre - paring to go.  Whatever the reason she should have come.  Though tired he agreed to show us th e garden.  13 adverbial modifiers of condition  e.g. He said he would do it if necessary.  But for the rain Id have gone off an hour ago.  To look at her you wouldnt believe she was a famous ac - tress.  14 adverbial modifiers of exception  e.g. He had no  choice but to obey the orders.  IX. The Attribute  Words in this function modify nouns and sometimes pro - nouns giving them some kind of characteristic.  Attributes may be expressed by an adjective a pronoun a  noun in the genitive or common case a noun with a preposition  an infinitive an ing -form a participle and occasionally an ad - verb.  Depending on the closeness of the syntactic ties between the  attribute and its noun we distinguish close and loose attributes.  Close attributes form a tight sense  unit with their nouns. Loose  attributes are less tightly connected with their nouns. Adding  more information to or explaining what is being said in the sen - tence they are regarded as a more independent member of the  sentence and hence often separated by a comma from the rest of  the sentence.  1 Close attributes  e.g. A large cat jumped down the window seat.  They gave each child a big apple.  Id like another cup of tea.  I borrowed two pounds from Janes brother.  I saw by their faces that they had learne d something new.  It was an act of despair on her part.  She admired his way of doing things.  He is not a man to rely on. The clouds were lit by the setting sun.  She saw the lighted windows of the cottage.  It was a pleasure to listen to him.  It was no use talking to her.  The then headmaster introduced the rule.  2 Loose attributes  e.g. Happy and carefree the children ran down the hill.  You behave like a schoolboy afraid of his teacher.  Painted green the house was almost invisible on the forest - covered hi ll. Craig took the baby out of the pram and lifted it high in the  air. The baby trying to tug at his moustache crowed glee - fully.  X. The Apposition  Words in this function modify nouns explaining and spec - ifying their meaning by giving them another nam e. Appositions are usually expressed by nouns.  e.g. Ann the daughter of the landlady was always ready to baby - sit for us.  I asked Miss Grey a neighbour and an old friend of mine to dinner.  The Glory a British steamship was to arrive on Monday  mornin g. XI. Independent Elements of the Sentence  Independent elements of the sentence are not directly connect - ed with any part of the sentence   they express the speakers at - titude to or comment on what is being said in the sentence as a  whole. In this func tion we usually find parenthetic expressions  viewpoint attitudinal and formulaic adverbs.  e.g. To tell the truth I didnt like her at first.  It isnt quite correct strictly speaking.  She will probably tell you about it herself.  It was a rainy day but fortunately it was not cold.  Historically the kings death was a minor event but it be - came widely known owing to its tragic circumstances.  Will you kindly keep me informed?  Syntactic Complexes  The subject -predicate relationship may be found in an Engli sh sentence not only between the grammatical subject and the finite  predicate but also in some phrases consisting of at least two ele - ments   a subject and a predicative. Such phrases usually  known as syntactic complexes differ from the real subject and  the predicate of the sentence in that they lack a finite verb and  therefore what is expressed in them cannot be directly related to  reality. It is done indirectly   by means of the phrase being syn - tactically connected with the predicate proper.  Syntacti c complexes may be of the following kinds  I. The Complex Object   a syntactic construction which is  lexically dependent and found after a limited number of verbs in  the Active Voice see Verbs  193 222 249 Nouns 21  Adjectives  7. The com plex object consists of a noun in the  common case or an indefinite pronoun or a personal pronoun in  the objective case serving as an object in the sentence and a pred - icative which may be expressed by a noun an adjective an ad - verb an infinitive with  or without the particle to an ing-form  and a participle.  e.g. His humour made him a welcome guest.  When they came they found the house empty.  I dont want any light on. Why dont you get somebody to explain it to you?  I watched her move away from us.  I felt him looking at me now and again.  I had never before seen the game played.  II. The Complex Subject   a syntactic construction which is  lexically dependent and found with a limited number of verbs in  the Passive Voice see Verbs  192 221 248 Nou ns  21 Adjectives  7. The complex subject consists of a noun in the  common case an indefinite pronoun or a personal pronoun in the  nominative case serving as the subject of the sentence and a sub - jective predicative which may be expressed by  a noun an adjec - tive an adverb an infinitive an ing -form and a participle.  e.g. Bob Skinner was made the leader of the team.  The door was painted green.  Everybody was found in. They were expected to agree.  The children were left playing on the floor.  The car was last seen parked at the hotel.  III. The Prepositional Infinitive Phrase   a syntactic con - struction which consists of a noun in the common case an indefinite  pronoun or a personal pronoun in the objective case and a predica - tive expressed by an infinitive. The whole of the phrase is joined to  the rest of the sentence by a preposition. Usually it is the preposi - tion for but sometimes the choice of the preposition is determined  by the verb the phrase depends on. See also Verbs  166.  e.g. He held out the papers for me to see. He was looking for someone to help him.  Her whole life had been spent listening to other people talk.  They appealed to him to give up the idea.  I arranged with the woman downstairs to keep the place clean.  You can rely on Father to forget nothing.  Prepositional infinitive phrases may perform different func - tions in the sentence.  e.g. For him to swear was such a rarity that David was not only  shocked but thoroughly startled subject  All he wanted was for me to get  out of his sight predicative  We were waiting for the train to arrive prepositional object  The boy stood aside for us to go by. adverbial modifier of  purpose  I was too young for them to tell me the truth adverbial  modifier of consequence  It was an easy plan for Roger to fulfil attribute  IV. The ing -Complex   a syntactic construction which consists  of a possessive pronoun or a personal pronoun in the objective case  or a noun in the common or genitive case and a predicative ex - pressed by an ing-form. See also Verb  166.  The ing -complex may perform different functions in the sen - tence.  e.g. At first she hadnt been sure that his coming here had been  a good thing subject  The only thing I am afraid of is the family being too sure of  themselves predicative  Thats a risk I just cant think of your taking prepositional  object  He could not approve of Guys hiding himself away preposi - tional object  Not a day had passed without that young man coming to at  least one meal adverbial m odifier of attending circum - stances  Of course you understand that after John breaking his ap - pointment Im never going to speak to him again adverbi - al modifier of time  I ought to have realized the possibility of such a thing hap - pening attribute  V. The Absolute Construction   a syntactic construction  which also consists of at least two elements   a subject and a  predicative but differs from the other syntactic complexes in  that its grammatical connection with the rest of the sentence is  much lo oser. It is often marked off by a comma. Absolute con - structions function as adverbial modifiers of attending circum - stances and description and may be joined to the sentence either  asyndetically or with the help of the preposition with or without.  The f irst element of the absolute construction is usually a  noun or a pronoun the second element may be expressed by an in - finitive an ing-iorm a participle a noun with or without a prep - osition an adjective or an adverb.  e.g. With nothing to do the act ors stood about and made small  talk.  She ran up the stairs her heart thumping painfully.  I wouldnt dare go home without the job finished.  He sat motionless his hands over his eyes.  I cant sleep with the radio on.  The Structure of the Composite Sentenc e A composite sentence consists of two or more simple sentences  joined together. The component parts of a composite sentence are  called clauses. The relationship between the clauses may be that  of coordination and subordination.  In the case of coordination  we have a compound sentence  whose clauses are independent of each other syntactically. They  may be joined by some coordinating conjunctions e.g. and but  or yet for etc. or asyndetically.  e.g. He was very busy now and they saw few of their friends.  I havent got much news to convey but there are some things  to add.  I began to miss London yet I was not coming back.  You can boil yourself an egg or Ill make you a cheese sand - wich.  He asked for food   there was none. My parents are quite  young they live their own life.  In the case of subordination one of the syntactic functions  within a simple sentence is expressed by a clause thereby forming  a complex sentence.  Cf. I know the girls name object  I know what the girls name is. object clause  She learned to play tennis at school adverbial modifier of  time  She learned to play tennis when she went to school adverbi - al clause of time  The basic structure is called the principal clause the clause  performing some syntactic function within the pr incipal clause is  termed a subordinate clause.  Structurally and semantically subordinate clauses are subor - dinated to principal clauses and may be joined to them by means  of conjunctions conjunctive words asyndetically and sometimes  by means of the seq uence of tenses.  Conjunctions a differ from conjunctive words b in that the  former are not members of either the principal or subordinate  clause while the latter perform some function within the subordi - nate clause.  e.g. a I know that he is right.  I was out when he came.  She had only a cup of tea because she was not hungry.  b He knew who had brought the letter.  They knew when I would come.  He showed me the watch that he was given as a birthday  present.  Subordinate clauses may perform various funct ions within the  principal clause. In comparison with the corresponding members  of the simple sentence they can be said to be more expressive  since they have a finite form in their structure.  For practical purposes of learning English it is necessary and  sufficient to distinguish the following kinds of subordinate clauses  1 subject clauses which perform the function of subject and  may be introduced by the conjunctions that if whether and such conjunctive words as who what which when why how and others. e.g. That you may meet him at the party is quite possible.  What I need now is someone to do the job.  2 predicative clauses which perform the function of pre - dicative and may be introduced by the same conjunctions and con - junctive words as subject c lauses see above.  e.g. His only desire was that his family shouldnt interfere with  his plans.  The question was why no one had heard the shot.  3 object clauses which modify verbs and adjectives as objects  to them and may be introduced by the same conjun ctions and con - junctive words as subject clauses see above.  e.g. I thought that they were joking.  We were sorry that we had missed Father by a few minutes.  It was announced over the radio that the flight was delayed.  It was urgent that we should tak e a decision.  It is very lucky that youre calling me now.  I wish you hadnt asked me that.  He found it important that they should start on the job  right away.  They took it for granted that his theory was correct.  Nobody knew what she meant.  He could not understand why they insisted on such a decision.  Time will show if whether he is right.  It was not clear what had happened and who was injured.  4 adverbial clauses which function as adverbial modifiers to  verbs and adjectives within the principal clause  and may be of the  following kinds  a adverbial clauses of time which are introduced by the con - junctions when while as until till before after since as soon  as as long as and some others  e.g. When they reached the village Jane got out of the taxi and  looked about her.  I wont leave until you come.  b adverbial clauses of place and direction which are in - troduced by the conjunction where  e.g. They stopped where the road turned to the river.  c adverbial clauses of cause which are introduced b y the con - junctions because as since and some others  e.g. He was glad to talk to her because it set her at ease.  d adverbial clauses of purpose which are introduced by the  conjunctions so that that in order that lest  e.g. He spoke loudly and clear ly so that all could hear him.  e adverbial clauses of condition which are introduced by the  conjunctions if in case unless and some others  e.g. If we start off now well arrive there by dinner time.  f adverbial clauses of concession which are introdu ced by the  conjunctions though although even if even though and wh-pro- nouns ending in -ever  e.g. Although it was very late she kept the dinner warm on the  stove.  Even if the fault is all his I must find a way to help him.  Whatever happens she won t have it her own way.  g adverbial clauses of consequence which are introduced by  the conjunctions that so ... that such ... that  e.g. He was so embarrassed that he could hardly understand her.  h adverbial clauses of comparison which are introduced by the  conjunctions than as as...as not so as...as as if and as though.  e.g. He now took better care of his old father than he had ever  done it before.  Her lips moved soundlessly as if she were rehearsing.  5 attributive clauses which modify nouns w ithin the principal  clause and are introduced by the conjunctive relative words that  whom which whose as when where and some others as well as  asyndetically see also Nouns  15  e.g. I know a man who can help us.  We caught a breeze that took us gently up the river.  All the presents that he had given her were in their usual  places.  Where is the letter which I gave you to read?  6 appositive clauses which modify nouns within the principal  clause and are introduced by the conjunction that. In form they  look like attributive clauses but in content they are similar to ob - ject clauses because they explain and specify the meaning of the  noun they refer to. It should be borne in mind that only a limited  number of abstract nouns can be modified by appositive clauses  for the lists of such nouns see Verbs  137 -138 204 230  e.g. I had the impression that she was badly ill.  We turned down his suggestion that we should take a boarder.  The thought that she was unhappy kept him awake all night.
